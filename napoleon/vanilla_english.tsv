Messengers may be intercepted but the use of the Great Paris Cipher means this is of little consequence. Through the clever use of a series of numbers used to represent letters it is now possible to send important messages without fear of them falling into enemy hands.\\n\\nThe Rossignols, a French family who had served as cryptographers for generations, created the Great Paris Cipher. One of their earlier code systems, simply known as ‘the Great Cipher’, was created for Louis XIV and used in a letter that is believed to hint at the identity of “the Man in the Iron Mask”, a prisoner who largely remains a mystery even today. The letter, discovered in 1890 by military historian Louis Gendron, was decrypted by Etienne Bazeries and seemed to suggest that the Man in the Iron Mask was in fact a general who had displeased Louis XIV.	false

Be it past victories, advances in education and technology, or a collection of treasures, such structures provide a stage to display achievements to the world. National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\\n\\nNelson’s Column was built to commemorate the death of the much-loved hero Admiral Horatio Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar. The column took three years to construct and is an impressive 185 feet tall. Atop the column stands a beautifully carved statue of Nelson himself, facing south towards the Admiralty and, very distantly, his ship HMS Victory, which is now docked in Portsmouth. Decorative acanthus leaves adorn Nelson’s feet, all cast in bronze from British cannons, and his most impressive victories over France are depicted on four decorative plates, each cast in gunmetal from captured French cannons.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sPrest_Russian_Monument	\\n\\nPride in one’s nation is a powerful thing, and what better way to instil national pride than to build a structure that celebrates the great achievements of the country? Be it past victories, advances in education and technology, or a collection of treasures, such structures provide a stage to display achievements to the world. National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\\n\\nThis monument was commissioned to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the end of the “Time of Troubles” and the ejection of the Poles from the Moscow Kremlin by Prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin. Funds for the statue were gathered from the residents of Nizhny Novgorod, the birth place of Kuzma Minin. The statue was given to Nizhny Novgorod but the sculptor, Ivan Martos, insisted that the best place for his creation was Moscow. There it remains to this day, even though the Communists considered it an obstruction to their parades.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_artillery_park_european	\\n\\nSmall arms may turn a rabble into a rebellion, but cannons create an army. Governments rightly want a monopoly on the ownership of heavy guns, and rightly see them as a measure of national power. A lack of guns severely hampers any military force, limiting it to little more than skirmish actions.\\n\\nOnce cast, artillery barrels could spend decades in storage. Providing that they were dry, there was little chance that they would come to much harm. When needed, a barrel was fitted to a gun carriage, ammunition and a limber found, and a piece was ready. Cannons could also be remade by fitting the barrel to a different carriage: a cannon for fortress use was mounted differently to a field gun.\\n\\nFire in an artillery park was a constant risk, bringing the danger of explosions, but damp conditions would ruin powder stocks just as surely. Water turned powder in a porridge, which then had to be dried very carefully and “corned” – turned into smooth grains of the right size – once again.

building_description_texts_long_description_rTimber1_timber_logging_camp_european	\\n\\nBuildings require large amounts of wood both in the structure and during the building process as scaffolding. Logging camps reduces the cost of other construction work, as timbers are cut and prepared centrally with great precision and speed. This building also makes an important contribution to the industrial wealth of the region.\\n\\nApart from its obvious uses in construction and as fuel, timber is also vital for shipbuilding. All vessels of the period are entirely wooden, and need hundreds of tons and many kinds of good quality timber each; building a logging camp should make the construction of all ships marginally cheaper.\\n\\nHistorically, the forests around the Baltic were an extremely useful strategic resource, as they became an excellent source of the trees needed for masts and yards for the British Royal Navy. By their nature, masts need tall trees! This need meant that the British interfered, almost constantly, in Baltic affairs. Other types of timber became important cash crops, such as the mahogany found in the Far East, prized for its strength and beauty.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_ottomans_naval_engineering_school	\\n\\nThe Naval Engineers’ School began as a training school at the Golden Horn shipyards, and was put on a formal footing by Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha (1713-90), the Grand Vizier of Sultan Mustafa III, and a Franco-Hungarian military adviser, François Baron de Tott. It was a part of Mustafa’s efforts to modernise the Turkish military and naval system in the face of considerable resistance from the janissaries and their leadership. The teaching given was extremely good, and produced fine officers.\\n\\nHasan Pasha is actually almost more interesting than the school, as he started life as a slave in eastern Turkey and rose through the ranks of the military. He even spent time with the Barbary Pirates of Algiers and, while there, domesticated a lion as a pet! Despite being on the losing side at Battle of Chesma in 1770 his ship, the 84-gun Real Mustafa, was one of the few on the Turkish side to emerge with any credit. His record certainly helped when it came to driving through the (limited) reforms that Mustafa managed to achieve. Baron de Tott’s other achievement was the establishment of a new cannon foundry.	false

technologies_long_description_military4_uniform_armament	\\n\\nA warship’s effectiveness can be measured by the weight of shot it fires in its broadside, and it makes excellent sense to have the heaviest cannons possible on board. However, too many different sizes of gun can make ammunition supply in the heat of battle more complicated than it need be, and different guns have different loading speeds, ballistic characteristics and crewing needs. By settling on only one size of gun, all these issues are resolved. An added bonus is that crewmen can be reassigned as needed to man guns, without necessarily needing any new instruction in their duties.\\n\\nNaval architect Sir Robert Seppings (1767-1840) introduced a remodelled and sturdier design for ships that incorporated a diagonal iron cross-bracing that greatly improved hull strength. Hulls built to his conception were stiffer, more seaworthy and able to accommodate a large number of heavy cannon on every deck. In 1826, the British Royal Navy took advantage of his new ideas and armed new ships with only one type of cannons: a formidably heavy 32-pounder!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCulture1_Theatre_european	\\n\\nA night at the theatre is a bawdy, rambunctious, rowdy, exciting and novel experience. It improves the happiness of all social classes and actually increases the town’s wealth slightly. Audiences are aggressively critical and show little respect: heckling is an art, and performers play to their claques rather than follow the text. The chattering classes eagerly await each new performance, each great actor-manager, and each new work.\\n\\nHistorically, theatres could mean a great deal of trouble for the authorities. Riots were not uncommon if unpopular or provocative plays were staged, and David Garrick, the leading light of the London stage, was once forced to kneel before a fickle audience. They were in the process of completely wrecking his theatre and his livelihood! Because of this public excitability, and the potential for subversive propaganda, in the interests of “public morality” all governments closely monitored theatre performances. Indeed, Great Britain only scrapped formal censorship of plays in 1968 when the Lord Chancellor’s Office no longer required London theatres to have its approval for every production. The censorious instinct still runs deep in some countries and some governments to this day.	false

If people live with fear and hatred they will be more likely to welcome a hero or rebel. Fostering anti-French sentiment and making sure it is used in war will increase the persuasive abilities of provocateurs and priests when they attempt to convert a region to an anti-French alignment.\\n\\nAs the less-able brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, Joseph was little more than a puppet on a throne, any throne. When Napoleon ordered him out of his comfortable palaces in Naples to the dangerous land of Spain he had little choice in the matter. The Spanish did not take kindly to having a French provincial thrust upon them and rumours soon began regarding Joseph’s character, or lack of it. He was credited with a reputation for drunkenness and debauchery that spawned a variety of insulting nicknames amongst the Spanish people including “Rey de Copas” or the King of Cups, and “Pepino” or cucumber. This last one was almost certainly to cast aspersions on his manhood. All rumour and innuendo served to weaken his authority and standing.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Light_Portuguese_Cazadores	\\n\\nLiterally translated, cazadores means “hunters” and huntsmen make up a large proportion of the rank and file, along with mountain men of various kinds. Their independent spirits naturally lend themselves to skirmishing. All of these men make their living in the wilds, and are excellent marksmen. However, in close combat or when facing cavalry, the cazadores are disadvantaged.\\n\\nHistorically, the cazadores were created to replace the light infantry units that had been sent to fight in the French army’s Portuguese Legion. Because the cazadores were a new unit, the Portuguese took the opportunity to give them elite status. Fearing French attacks along the mountainous Spanish border, men familiar with the terrain were the first choice of recruits. Despite problems in finding enough weapons for them, the cazadores went on to garner an impressive reputation, becoming the elite force the Portuguese government so needed.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1248357663	The seemingly unstoppable armies of Napoleon are a great threat to all Europe, but for now Prussia should keep their own counsel. Britain, Austria, and Russia have requested you join the war effort against Napoleon, but for now the King prefers to observe the progress of the conflict from afar before acting decisively one way or the other - as German states may be under threat from both France and Austria. As the leading German nation, it is up to Prussia to protect the sovereignty of those states. Perhaps it would be better to annex them yourself to guarantee their independence from French imperialism? The best strategy is to build your armies up to full strength whilst France and Austria fight it out, then ally with the power who best serves Prussian interests. All the while the Russian bear looms in the east, eager to sweep the German-speaking parts of Poland into its mighty paw. Whatever happens next, delaying for too long will result in the destruction of Prussian possessions across its rightful homelands - something that must not be allowed to happen.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Light_Russian_Jager	\\n\\nHard-working and hard-drinking, these hard men are hardened to every conceivable hardship; they are tough, and loyal soldiers to their superior officers. The jägers remain in the Russian army until the day they die, almost as military serfs; most of them were serfs anyway. They have a lifetime of experience of living off the land, and a fearsome reputation for being rather barbaric. Despite this, they are not well suited to the discipline of close combat, and are much more use when peppering an enemy with musket balls.\\n\\nStrangely, the Tsar’s troops were assigned regiments depending on their physical size. The tallest always became grenadiers, and the smallest were destined for the jäger battalions. But physique is no guarantee of soldierly qualities and in 1811 Field Marshal Barclay de Tolly changed the system so that personal merit and worth determined a man’s assignment. Even more strangely, this practice of “sizing” soldiers went on in the Russian Soviet army as well, but for the practical reason that tall or bulky men simply would not fit into tanks: the design philosophy of Russian tanks was to make them as low as possible, hence the lack of space inside.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Lancer_French_7th_Lancers	\\n\\nThe lance is probably the oldest cavalry weapon. It allows the user to put all his weight, and that of his charging horse, behind one very sharp point. In the hands of a skilled man that point can be driven right through a man. This makes lances intimidating to face but, if a lancer does not kill his target, he is vulnerable: a lance is less use than a sword in a melee, so the lancer is at a disadvantage. This is also true against well-trained infantry capable of forming square.\\n\\nHistorically, many nations used lancers. Napoleon even recruited Polish lancers to be part of his Imperial Guard. Surprisingly, each type of cavalry regiment required its own set of horse furniture, especially designed for the tactics that would be used. Lancer saddles tended to be made of beech wood, covered in black leather and reinforced with metal bands. They differed from the more elaborate dragoon saddle that required holsters for pistols, and a heavy sheepskin to protect the weapons and the lower body of the rider.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Irreg_Ottoman_Bashi_Bazouks	\\n\\nMore than happy to run headlong into an enemy force with nothing but a sword and bared teeth, the Bashi Bazouks are berserk madmen. When engaged in close combat, they are second to none. Their upkeep and recruitment costs are minimal, making them an ideal unit for those with tight purse strings. However, due to their lack of discipline and firearms they are vulnerable to both cavalry and missile-armed troops.\\n\\nHistorically, the original Turkish form of “Bashi Bazouk” literally meant “damaged head” or “leaderless”. These men were raised from all over the Ottoman Empire, although they originally came from tribes based in Afghanistan. They were never given uniforms, but did receive their weapons from the Ottoman government. Plunder was their only real payment, and this was considered legitimate by the government. Their lawless ways made them difficult to control and they often had to be forcibly disarmed after taking part in battles. This unpredictable nature gave them a fearsome reputation and other nationalities generally feared them as brutal and savage warriors.	false

technologies_long_description_military2_grand_battery	\\n\\nThe Grand Battery is an artillery tactic which involves amassing all available artillery into one huge battery and then concentrating its fire on a single point in the enemy line. The concentrated fire also makes for a devastating attack that can blast through enemy lines and structures. The massed nature of this fire given improves the accuracy and effectiveness of artillery units in battle.\\n\\nIn reality, the Grand Battery was an ingenious new tactic that, for a while, gave Napoleon the edge over his enemies. At Wagram and Borodino it was used, respectively, to break an enemy line in the centre and repel an enemy counter attack. As with all ingenious tactics, there was an ingenious counter attack: Wellington and other generals started deploying their troops well out of range of any grand battery. Wellington employed this tactic to great effect at the Battle of Waterloo, deploying his men safely out of range and just to be sure, on the reverse slope of a hill, hiding them from any direct fire.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_star_fort_indian	\\n\\nWith thick, high walls, impressive towers and many gun positions, the impression created by a fort for any attacker is of overwhelming strength. It will take time and effort to invest such a fort, break its walls with cannon fire and then organise an attack. All the while, the attackers will be prey to disease, starvation and the climate! The defenders may only have to wait for the attackers’ will to fail.\\n\\nBeyond Europe, the fortification ideas of Vauban and others did not really take root until the arrival of European powers and armies. Traditional fort designs continued in use because they were good enough for their purpose: they intimidated local rebels, and were difficult for them to assault because, as noted, they were unlikely to have substantial artillery siege trains. The “old fashioned” designs were therefore good enough when it took a courageous commander, or a lucky one, to mount a successful attack. There are, however, accounts of an Able Seaman Strahan single-handedly (!) capturing the “fort” (the size is not specified) at Baj-Baj on the Hooghly River in Bengal during Robert Clive’s 1756 campaign.	false

The members are also in charge of powder production for the army and navy too, an attempt to limit bureaucratic muddle and rivalry between services. The Ordnance is an important national asset because artillery is very expensive and a measure of state power.\\n\\nHistorically, great guns and siege weapons always required specialists to operate them, men quite separate from common soldiery. In charge was a Master of Ordnance, a man of some importance in medieval royal households. Looking after the monarch’s artillery train required a large staff of gunners, founders, powder makers, mathematicians, surveyors, and even wagon drivers. In time, all of these men came under the control of the Board or Council of Ordnance. As with all government departments, they made sure that their power increased over time, and they eventually controlled the management of fortresses and, in some cases, the manufacture of all weapons for the state.	false

technologies_long_description_economy1_bottling_canning	\\n\\nDiet-related ailments at sea can be reduced or eliminated by eating fresh food. Sealing food in airtight containers keeps it fresh; dried biscuits and bread may last longer than fruit or meat, but on their own they are not sufficient to sustain crew health or morale. Instead, bottled and canned foods can be taken aboard at the start of a journey, providing good meals for all. This technique not only preserves the food, but its goodness as well: the crew are better for eating good food, and naval upkeep costs are reduced.\\n\\nIn 1800 the French government, recognising the truth of “an army marches on its stomach”, offered a reward to anyone who could come up with a way of providing armies with safe food. After years of experimenting, French confectioner Nicolas Appert (1749-1841) noticed that food boiled in sealed containers only went off once air was admitted. He won the prize and put his foods into production in 1810 at the world’s first cannery.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Skirm_Portuguese_Tiradores	\\n\\nArmed with rifles and an excellent knowledge of fieldcraft, Tiradores could shoot the cockade off a dragoon at 100 paces. “Tiradores” is Portuguese for sharpshooters and nothing describes these men better. They fight in loose formation and are ideal for harassing the enemy from a distance, using their ability to hide in all kinds of terrain. However, should these men be drawn into close combat they will suffer heavy losses. Any contact with cavalry could prove disastrous.\\n\\nIn 1808, as Napoleon continued to dominate Europe, Portugal found that it was totally without regular light infantry units. Those that had been raised with the all-arms light corps in 1796 had been drafted into the French army’s Portuguese Legion. New light infantry would need to be recruited, equipped and trained from nothing. These new light infantry were called “Caçadores”, the Portuguese for hunters, and within each battalion were four companies of ordinary Cazadores and one company of elite “Tiradores”.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Line_Infantry	\\n\\n“Marching regiments” or “line battalions” make up the majority of units in most armies. They are so called because they form the line of battle, not because they always deploy in a line. In fact, when faced with a cavalry charge, it is wise to form square for protection. Their strength comes from their close formation which gives them firepower and strength in melee, but this also leaves them vulnerable to artillery and skirmishers.\\n\\nHistorically, these soldiers carried muzzle-loading, smoothbore muskets firing lead balls as wide as a man’s thumb. These were inaccurate weapons, effective only over 200 paces or so. They were usually fired in massed volleys to increase the chance of the target being hit! This also meant that the whole unit was busy reloading at the same time. To counter this, the British Army perfected a kind of continuous rolling barrage called platoon fire. A regiment would divide itself into two halves and fire alternately, so that while one “platoon” (the modern use of the word has a different meaning) was firing, the other was loading.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_drydock_european	\\n\\nWithin the dry dock, the ship is supported on blocks, and extra timbers are used to wedge firmly upright as the water is removed. By carefully timing the movement of a ship to take advantage of high and low tides, the amount of pumping (by hand) is minimised. Movements into and out of the dock are tidal, and work must be finished by the next high tide. \\n\\nThe advantages of being able to work on a warship and then float it away are considerable. Dry docks are equally useful for construction and repair, and are often at the centre of a large complex of workshops specialising in every aspect of shipbuilding.\\n\\nThe organisation required for all this activity means that the craft-based skills of the master shipwright are still valuable, but naval architects producing plans, drawings and schedules are now a vital part of the process. Naturally, the master of the docks can treat the entire enterprise as his own (as long as he delivers the ships needed) and award contracts as he sees fit to his friends and cronies! Officials making profits from the government’s investment was an accepted cost of business and, provided the men were not too greedy, an assurance that they were looking after their interests and those of the navy!	false

Keep abreast of technology by assigning scholars to research all the latest developments. Maintaining friendly relations with a major European power – possibly France – will prove useful should Russia and Austria rise against you.

events_event_text_luddite_movement	Textile workers in Great Britain have begun protests at recent advances in technology that they feel are an assault on their livelihoods. The new wide-framed automated looms do not require skilled labour, and as a result many have lost their jobs and fallen further into abject poverty.\\n\\nHeaded by the (probably fictional) character Ned Ludd, the Luddites have begun smashing mill machinery and setting fire to factories as their leader is said to have done thirty years hence. Beginning in Nottinghamshire, the Luddite movement is spreading rapidly across the industrialised midlands and gradually moving northwards to Yorkshire and Lancashire.\\n\\nIn addition to machine breaking, mill owners, magistrates, and merchants have received death threats, causing the government to take serious action against the protestors. The Luddites exist in such numbers that the army have been deployed to combat the situation, and harsh sentences are being handed down by the courts – including transportation to Australia, and in some cases execution.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_trading_company_european	\\n\\nTrading companies can be enormous, with fleets of armed merchant ships carrying all manner of cargoes. The successors to the medieval merchant adventurers, they generate fantastic wealth from their operations. Usually granted a government monopoly in either a geographic area or in a set of trade goods, the companies can also act as a privatised diplomatic service in distant corners of the globe. They are known to do deal with local potentates for trade concessions, military access, tax farming and they have taken over native governments by imposing their “advisors”.\\n\\nHistorically, the great East India companies of Britain, France and the Netherlands were armed, quasi-independent mercantile mini-states. The British East India Company was wealthy almost beyond imagining: its trade represented about one-sixth of the British national income. Like the French “Compagnie française pour le commerce des Indes orientales” and Dutch “Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie”, the “John Company” had its own fleet and army. In India it fought wars and had its own foreign policy, giving the British government little choice but to support its actions. In modern times only petrochemical, mining and arms companies have commanded comparable power over nations.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tEducation2_university_european	\\n\\nA university offers young men from good families a fine education, and the chance to study the greatest achievements of mankind. As a result there is a chance that, each turn, this university may produce a gentleman, a useful agent for his nation. The faculty also aids research into new technologies, but may produce a wish for reform among the people; even though the university is socially conservative, it cannot keep all progressive thoughts away from its students.\\n\\nA good education was useful for those who wished to make their way in the world using talent as well as family connections. A young gentleman’s studies were wide ranging, and not tied to any particular subject area: an awarded degree or doctorate was proof enough of some intellectual achievement. Historically, the established church in many countries had established the universities, and continued to run them. This meant that the university as a body rarely challenged the established order of things; the teachers and students both had vested interests in the status quo. While wild, threatening ideas about the world and the way it should work did emerge, the universities were rarely radical or revolutionary breeding grounds.	false

technologies_long_description_military3_conscript_infantry_tactics	\\n\\nAs the recruitment process for modern armies changes, tactics need to be re-evaluated and altered. Previously, armies had been made up of sometimes-willing volunteers, who were well trained and fiercely disciplined. Conscription provides a new challenge for military tacticians: how best to deploy an army to prevent desertion and give men no choice but to fight. Once these new infantry tactics have been researched and developed, new military academies can be constructed to spread these radical ideas.\\n\\n Conscript infantry tactics owe their creation, in theory at least, to the French general Count Jacques-Antonine-Hippolyte de Guibert (1743-1790). He was a controversial tactical writer who published his “Essai general de tactique” in 1770 and was notorious for his advanced social opinions. He had been discussing the finer points of mass conscription (which became known as “levee en masse”) long before it became the French military system. He briefly held the position of chief military advisor to the French government but it was soon apparent that the government was not ready for his brand of radical thinking.	false

technologies_long_description_admin3_anti_french_propaganda	\\n\\nMocking and vilifying an enemy is a vital part of warfare. People have to be convinced that their enemies are monsters, given to all manner of terrible crimes and yet their leaders are foolish straw men to be laughed at. To repeat this message definitely helps stoke the patriotic fires. Anything that can attract recruits is a sound investment in wartime, and this anti-French campaign of merciless mockery, misinformation and exaggeration helps improve the replenishment rate of irregular troops.\\n\\nHistorically, most Britons accepted the image of Napoleon as a ‘Corsican Ogre’ without question. Nursery rhymes warned naughty children that Napoleon, “Limb from limb, will tear you, Just as pussy tears a mouse.” This kind of imagery was hardly needed in Spain, where the brutal anti-guerrilla tactics of the French army provided bloody grist to the mill of popular opinion. The Spaniards hardly needed to do more than repeat the juicier war stories of French cruelty, whilst carefully excusing their own patriotic banditry against the French. As the little war spiralled out of control, propaganda that cast the French in the worst possible light helped to bolster Spanish hatred and eagerness to be part of the struggle.	false

technologies_long_description_admin3_trade_unions	\\n\\nOnce the ideas of revolution, liberty, and equality are mooted, the poor and downtrodden will want to know why these concepts do not apply equally to them. The growth of combinations and workers’ organisations is inevitable in societies where poverty can mean more than just low pay, but starvation. Trade unions give workers the ability to negotiate with employers from a position of strength: the individual can be dismissed, but not the whole workforce. Trade unions improve the happiness of the lower classes, and enable the construction of higher level law courts.\\n\\nHistorically, trade unions were declared illegal and widely feared by the landed and moneyed classes in most societies. The idea that the poor would dare to ask for more of anything, except a good horsewhipping, was only one step away from armed insurrection. The British reaction of passing the 1799 and 1825 Combination Acts was typical, as was the deportation to Australia of the “Tolpuddle Martyrs”, a group of agricultural labourers who had dared to form a society with the aim of obtaining better pay and conditions for themselves.	false

The bottom section shows the rate of and factors contributing to population growth; the middle section details how the wealth level of individual towns affects the region as a whole; the top section shows the status of public order, split into two classes.\\n\\nObedience to the system of government within a nation is measured in public order. If unhappiness begins to outweigh happiness and state repression at any point then the resultant unrest can lead to rebellion, if left unchecked. Keeping taxes at reasonable levels, and leaving troops as a garrison, will in most cases keep order in a region.\\n\\nThe grey pips in the public order section of this panel represent state repression - either from your government type, or via intimidation from garrisoned units. Whilst it is useful to keep the population in order, rebellion following a period of heavy repression can be difficult to suppress.\\n\\nThe overall happiness of a population is split between the ruling class and lower orders, with different factors contributing to the happiness level of each. Rebellion becomes a risk when part of the population is so unhappy that state repression can no longer contain public disorder. Always try to ensure that public order values remain positive!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Elite_British_Black_Watch	\\n\\nEquipped like other line regiments with muskets and bayonets, the Black Watch are easily distinguished on the field by their bonnets and dark tartan kilts. This alone marks them out as something special. They are an excellent unit, with high morale and extremely good fighting characteristics. They are particularly fearsome when charging home, as Highlanders have a reputation for savagery in battle that is all their own. Like all line infantry, however, their courage counts for little if they are left exposed to artillery fire.\\n\\nThe 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot recruited most of its soldiers in Scotland and supposedly got its nickname from the dark green tartan sett that the regiment wore; unlike other Scottish units, it did not wear a clan tartan but a government-issue pattern.  The regiment was originally raised after the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 to police the more rampantly Tory (rebel) clans. In this, it was only partly successful. The 42nd fought under Wellington in Spain and were present at both Quatre Bras and Waterloo in 1815. The regiment still exists in the British Army as the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland, and retains many of the proud traditions and values of its forebears.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tSecret2_secret_society_spain	\\n\\nThe business of secret societies is, well, secret. What goes on behind their closed doors and in hidden chambers is a mystery, wrapped in misdirection and cloaked in falsehood. This building supports a number of spies and provocateurs, and increases the chance that they may be produced each turn. It also has a positive effect on the happiness of all classes: who knows who might be watching, or listening? Surely it is better to be happy than attract unwelcome attention with frowns!\\n\\nSecret societies have always attracted a good deal of attention because of their secrecy, and many have been accused of conspiracies to do everything, from running a single country to running the whole world. Thanks to the secrecy of the Masons, they have often been suspected of many nefarious activities. A typical “secret” society founded in the early 19th Century is American: the “Skull and Bones Society”, set up by Yale University students. Its secrecy probably owed more to a desire not to have parents and university officials know just how much drinking was going on, but in recent years it has been the subject of many conspiracy theories. In 2007 the American CIA felt it necessary to deny rumours that it owed its establishment to a cabal of Skull and Bones members!	false

technologies_long_description_economy3_steam_locomotive	\\n\\nA stationary steam engine can be used to haul loads along a track by means of ropes or chains, but it is much more convenient for the engine to move with the train. Plateways and railways are not new ideas, but the application of mobile steam power is a revolution. Railways linking mines, ports, and cities make the world smaller, but also give men of business unparalleled opportunities for trade, so allowing increased industrial expansion.\\n\\nHistorically, steam engines were a wonder of the age when they were introduced to public service, despite the fact that the first day of the first passenger railway in the world resulted in the death of an important local politician. In 1830, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway held a grand celebration. William Huskisson, the Liverpool Member of Parliament, dithered when a train approached at speed, and was run down. His leg was severed, and it took the unfortunate fellow some time to die from shock and blood loss. Despite killing a well-loved worthy, the L&M was an engineering triumph and a financial success, ushering in the railway age.	false

Troops have all the weapons and support they need, when needed. A military supply port not only improves the capacity of a port to move material to and from armies and trade posts, it also reduces recruitment costs, increases the available space for a garrison and enables the construction of better ships.\\n\\nHistorically, the Royal Navy knew the importance of securing their own supplies and limiting those of the enemy. Often raiding parties were sent ashore to destroy naval timber stock, and in particular masts, stored in enemy yards. Destroying timber stocks not only set back shipbuilding by many years, but also ensured that battle damage was hard to repair. Burning war materials rather than stealing them must have gone against the natural, and slightly piratical, inclinations of many officers and seamen: their prize money was going up in smoke!	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1268665964	It is 1811 and the war in the Spanish Peninsula has been raging for over two years, with mixed fortunes and heavy casualties for both sides. Following the withdrawal from the Madrid area of the combined armies of Great Britain, Portugal and Spain after the Battle of Talavera in July 1809 - a costly stalemate for the allies - Viscount Wellington retreated into Portugal and consolidated his forces, also authorising the construction of a series of connected forts and earthworks - the Lines of Torres Vedras. Now Napoleon’s Armée d'Espagne, led by Marshal Masséna, has invaded Portugal once again but thus far the network of entrenchments has proved impossible for the French to successfully assail. Fresh troops have been sent from England, available via the construction and control of supply ports in coastal regions. Upon their arrival Wellington has planned a fresh offensive to drive the invaders out of Portugal and eventually out of the Peninsula altogether. Resistance to French rule by the Spanish has led to small local bands using "guerrilla" tactics - meaning "little war". Guerrilla warfare allows French forces to be eroded through constant harassment by irregulars, supported by local inhabitants, who attack with the element of surprise and are able to melt back into the countryside as quickly as they appear. It is hoped that the guerrillas, in combination with a reinvigorated British army, can drive the forces of Imperial France from the Peninsula region once and for all.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_pSupplySpain1_supply_port	\\n\\nMoving military supplies by land is difficult and expensive; most roads are simply terrible! Anything that has to be moved more than a few miles goes by water whenever possible. A supply port lets a nation moves goods to where they are needed with a fair degree of efficiency. Military supplies go out, and goods from trading posts arrive from across the world.\\n\\nDuring the 19th century, the British had the most powerful navy in the world as a virtuous circle of sea trade funded its existence, and a strong navy allowed even more trade. The new “industrial revolution” meant that manufactured goods were there to be traded across the world. Trade was important because it allowed Britain to finance wars as well as fight them. Allies could be supported with gold rather than men in the field. This was what prompted Bonaparte’s Continental System of blockading British trade. It didn’t work terribly well, but Napoleon knew that the way to beat Britain was to starve the country of money.	false

Properly served and loaded with canister shot, guns turn the fort’s approaches into death traps for any attacking force.\\n\\nThe fort has to be strongly constructed to withstand repeated pounding by attacking cannons, and the recoil of its own pieces. Firing by even small cannons, such as nine-pounders, causes tremendous strains on any structure. The other risk to the fort is, of course, fire. While the fabric of the building itself will not burn, the magazine holding the powder and shot for the fort can catch fire and explode.\\n\\nHistorically, it was not unknown for defenders to blow their own forts up, by accident or design. The powder magazine was a dangerous place, and required rigid adherence to correct procedures by everyone if disaster was to be avoided. On one occasion at Fort York, during the War of 1812, the defending British set off the magazine as they withdrew to deny the contents to the American attackers, killing hundreds of the assault force in the explosion.	false

There is an obvious need to make sure that units receive orders and supplies in a timely manner – and without unscrupulous suppliers stealing too much money. Headquarters staff must also organise transport in co-operation with the navy, keep a list of officers and their commissions, organise parades to impress the great and the good, and offer assistance to the civil power in times of need. \\n\\nHistorically, European armies were organised in an ad hoc fashion in the 18th Century. Usually, the biggest permanent formations in existence were regiments; armies were assembled as-and-when a crisis loomed under the command of favoured general. Even so, the concept of the central command telling colonels what to do with their regiments often met stiff opposition. The Ottoman and Mughal empires were better organised in theory, and did have larger permanent formations such as corps and divisions.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCulture5_French_Musée_Napoléon	\\n\\nPride in one’s nation is a powerful thing, and what better way to instil national pride than to build a structure that celebrates the great achievements of the country? Be it past victories, advances in education and technology, or a collection of treasures, such structures provide a stage to display achievements to the world. National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\\n\\nHistorically, the Musee Napoleon was originally built as a fortress to protect France from the Anglo-Norman threat in medieval times. The fortress was converted and renamed several times, eventually becoming a museum called the “Louvre”. This name remained with the building until the reign of Napoleon, when it was renamed in his honour. A bust of Napoleon by Bartolini was installed over the entrance. Napoleon went on to expand the collections during his campaigns by looting, although most countries claimed their treasures back following the fall of the Empire in 1815.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Elite_Russian_Semenovski_Lifeguard	\\n\\nThe steadiness displayed by the men of the Semenovski Lifeguard is amazing, and on the battlefield they inspire nearby troops to hold fast by their example. These men are incredibly disciplined, and they are excellent marksmen with fast reloading times, though their close formations leave them vulnerable to artillery fire and skirmishers. Being an elite unit, the regiment is expensive to recruit, but the men’s abilities more than justify the extra cost.\\n\\nThe Russian Lifeguards were famed for their fine appearance. They were hand-picked for looks and stature, and even had jackets padded around the chest and shoulders to enhance their impressive physiques. Lady Burghersh (wife of the Military Commissioner at the Allies’ Headquarters and a prolific letter writer) believed them to be “the handsomest of the empire… all gigantic; they are composed of the tallest men in Russia.” Even von Schubert was forced to concede that these men were “the focal point of the balls and every other kind of society.” However, their immaculate good looks did not imply equally good manners and, at a banquet held in their honour, Napoleon’s own guards were appalled to see the Russians tearing meat with their hands, draining glasses of wine in one gulp, and even vomiting to make room for more gluttony and drinking!	false

technologies_long_description_admin3_abolition_of_slavery	\\n\\nThe slave trade is hugely profitable for those who engage in it, whether through trade such as that from Africa to the New World, or conquest such as the depredations of European shipping by the Barbary Pirates of North Africa. The morality and necessity of slave owning, however, are disputed. Abolition of the trade has its roots in religious feelings and in radical Enlightenment thought, but its effects are clear: a cessation of slave taking, transportation and exploitation.\\n\\nHistorically, abolition was far from universally popular. William Wilberforce (1759-1833), the MP for Kingston-upon-Hull in Yorkshire, campaigned for many years in the face of bitter opposition from mercantile interests. His eventual success only outlawed slavery in British possessions and British involvement in any foreign trade. The Royal Navy acted as a “world policeman”, attempting to stop the African trade at source. Oddly, English judges had already decided that slaves could become free by stepping onto English soil in 1772. Wilberforce’s work was the start of a process that continues even today with attempts to stop “people trafficking”.	false

A man who cannot fight is unlikely to survive the life of feuding and banditry that is his lot. Unlike many of their enemies, the shaturnal camel gunners are extremely swift and manoeuvrable force, and have perfected their skirmish tactics. An extra edge in combat is gained from their camels: enemy horses are easily scared by these gurning, spitting creatures!\\n\\nHistorically, a shaturnal was a kind of swivel gun mounted on the back of a camel or an elephant. Rather than using the camel to simply transport the gun, the weapon was actually fired with the gun still attached to the animal. Because there was no need to dismount to use the weapon, it could be brought into action very quickly.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Art_Foot_Experimental_Howitzer	\\n\\nHowitzers fall somewhere between guns and mortars, the other main artillery types. Like guns, they can be moved, if slowly. They do not fire straight at the target, but lob shots high into the air to plunge down on a target. The charge of powder and the barrel angle can be varied, which means a howitzer can lob missiles over a wall or intervening woods. In close action, they can fire canister rounds directly into enemy formations, blasting them with hundreds of musket balls. These experimental batteries can also fire carcass shells and quicklime rounds, setting fire to enemy structures or poisoning enemy troops with caustic chemicals.\\n\\nHistorically, ballistics was not an imperfectly-understood science and, apart from inaccurate targeting, a shell did not necessarily do any damage when it arrived. Erratic winds could send shells off course. Shell fuses had to be lit while still in the barrel, and the length of fuse judged to match the flight time. If the fuse was too short, the shell could explode in mid air; too long and the enemy might be able to put it out before it exploded!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_western_artillery_fort_european	\\n\\nAn artillery fort has strong walls and parapets with embrasures: gaps for cannons to fire through at attackers. Properly served and loaded with grape or canister shot, guns turn the approaches to the fort into death traps for any attacking infantry.\\n\\nThe fort has to be strongly constructed to withstand repeated pounding by attacking cannons, and by the recoil of its own pieces. Repeated firing by even small cannons, such as nine-pounders, causes tremendous strains on the structure. The other risk to the fort is, of course, fire. While the fabric of the building itself will not burn, the magazine holding the powder and shot for the fort can catch fire and explode.\\n\\nHistorically, it was not unknown for defenders to blow their own forts up, by accident or design. The powder magazine was a dangerous place, and required rigid adherence to correct procedures by everyone if disaster was to be avoided. On one occasion at Fort York, during the War of 1812, the defending British set off the magazine as they withdrew to deny the contents to the American attackers, killing hundreds of the assault force in the explosion.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_Generals_Bodyguard	\\n\\nA routing unit can often cause other units to doubt themselves, and panic can easily spread through the ranks. When soldiers waver, a general’s presence can inspire courage and make men redouble their efforts. His importance also makes him a target for the enemy; a sensible general has a bodyguard of his best soldiers. These men are fiercely loyal and protective of their general, never leaving his side unless all else is lost.\\n\\nIn 1796, General Napoleon Bonaparte created his own bodyguard of 200 men after a too-close call with some Austrian cavalry. These men were forerunners to the Chasseurs à Cheval of the Guard. Naturally, being the first, they were favoured by Napoleon. Indeed, they were called the ‘Favoured Children’ and, like all children, were often indulged too much and undisciplined. Still, only the most talented men would be recruited to guard the Emperor and, during many of his battles, they proved their skill and bravery in defence of their Emperor.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCulture5_Austrian_Theater	\\n\\nPride in one’s nation is a powerful thing, and what better way to instil national pride than to build a structure that celebrates the great achievements of the country? Be it past victories, advances in education and technology, or a collection of treasures, such structures provide a stage to display achievements to the world. National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\\n\\nThis theatre in the heart of Vienna was built thanks to the efforts of Emanuel Schikander. Although he started as an actor he was soon leading his own company and performing plays set to the music of Mozart. It was the Magic Flute, set to music by Mozart, that propelled Schikander to the height of his fame. The play also helped in the building of the Theater an der Wien: Schikander’s lavish productions had outgrown the smaller Theater auf de Wieden and required a more sumptuous setting. This need for grandeur proved to be the downfall of Schikander, who eventually died penniless and insane on the streets of Vienna.	false

This versatility makes them incredibly useful on the battlefield. Their only real vulnerability is when facing cavalry, as they are unable to form square, the standard defence against cavalry charges.\\n\\nAll of Europe breathed a collective sigh in 1814. The Treaty of Fontainbleau brought an end to hostilities and halted Napoleon’s domination of Europe. The ink was barely dry on this agreement when the British government started to divide up Wellington’s army. Some were sent off to the war in America, others were discharged at home. The King’s German Legion was considered incredibly valuable and escaped this cull. However, all the non-Hanoverian troops were discharged or transferred to other foreign corps. As a result the numbers of the Legion were greatly reduced, leaving only 7,000 in the Legion at Waterloo, but they were all proud sons of Hanover!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Frigate_British_Razee	\\n\\nIn effect, a small ship of the line is sawn in two, horizontally, and the top deck removed completely. The resulting ship has a hull that was originally constructed to withstand the recoil of heavy guns and, as a result, it is far stronger than an ordinary, purpose-built frigate. The loss of a deck and guns improves the ship’s handling too, and a razee is manoeuvrable and speedy. The overall result is a very strong, powerful vessel that is better than its donor battleship or a frigate.\\n\\nHistorically, few razees were actually made, as sacrificing a ship-of-the-line to make a weaker vessel was not an action that many admiralties could get their political masters to approve. However, one of the most successful examples was HMS Indefatigable, under Edward Pellew. In the company of another frigate, Pellew took on, and defeated, the Droits de l'Homme, a French 74 ship-of-the-line, in 1797. This victory was rightly considered a stunning feat of seamanship and command. During the next year or so, Pellew and the Indefatigable went on to take a further nine vessels.	false

They are armed with curved sabres and these can cause terrible wounds in hand-to-hand combat. Although they are skilled in close combat and cavalry charges, Deli Horsemen are primarily favoured for their speed across ground. This makes them an obvious choice to destroy vulnerable skirmishers and artillery.\\n\\nHistorically, Deli infantrymen and cavalry were irregular troops, and horsemen would often find employment guarding caravans and important dignitaries. By the late 18th century, the elite horsemen of the feudal Sipahis had largely disappeared, and most of the Ottoman cavalry force was made up of the irregular Deli horse. They had no uniforms to speak of, but could be recognised by their black felt hats. The other point of recognition, for as long as an enemy lived, was their spectacular mixture of whatever weaponry they could find or steal!	false

Once in India, they will join forces with Tippu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore, and drive the hated English into the sea! Such is the grandeur of the scheme and, in General Napoleon Bonaparte, there is a commander of equal grandeur to undertake it.\\n\\nBefore this can be achieved, however, there are more immediate obstacles. Egypt is ruled by the Mamelukes, who are nominally loyal servants of the Ottoman Empire. In the burning heat of the desert, Frenchmen must march on Alexandria and break their power before anything else can be achieved. But here, in this land of ancient secrets, there is glory to be won!\\n\\nGlory enough for France, and glory enough, possibly, for General Bonaparte!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCannon3_great_arsenal_european	\\n\\nThe development of new cannons is an expensive and sometimes risky business, and is one that the state likes to keep under its immediate control. No government likes to contemplate rebellion, and central control of heavy artillery is a wise policy. Large guns are necessary for armies (and navies, for that matter) to operate effectively and advances in this field allow new artillery units to be recruited. The ability of a nation to project its power in war is, in large part, measured by the size and variety of its artillery.\\n\\nHistorically, the arsenals of many states were peacetime stores for cannons, shot, and powder. Domestic peacekeeping by an army rarely required artillery to be deployed. Once cast, a cannon barrel could spend decades in storage before being mounted on an appropriate carriage and used in anger. The gun carriage used for a barrel would determine its use; a gun for use in fortifications did not need to be dragged across open country. Gunpowder, too, could spend neglected years in storage, and this caused all kinds of problems when it was finally issued to gunners: dried out or damp powder would not burn evenly and could cause gun barrels to burst when fired.	false

technologies_long_description_military2_guerrilla_training_network	\\n\\nResearching a guerrilla training network means guerrillas can be trained in more effective tactics such as ambushes, traps and the use of subterfuge. It will also help them to think and fight more like a military unit, giving guerrillas more experience in battle. A training network is made possible by the support of the Spanish population: as well as being sympathetic to the cause, they will clothe, feed and hide guerrillas and advisors, or perhaps even join the fight against the French!\\n\\nThe French invasion of Spain crippled the Spanish government, making it hard for them to organise and fight back. In the vacuum created by no central state, small juntas took local control. These juntas immediately set about rallying guerrilla groups to harass the French. The guerrillas’ popularity made them difficult to hunt down, even after they started a brutal retaliation against suspected guerrilla sympathisers. This lack of success was a blow to French morale, who had not only to contend with a conventional war but also the vicious hostility of the local people.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_1247826843	It is a crucial time in the war between France and the Coalition. With the majority of French forces engaging Austria in the Rhineland, you have been placed in command of the destitute Armée d’Italie near the French-Italian border. Faced with  impending invasion from Austrian forces stationed in Italy, it is vital that you address your army’s dire situation and secure a foothold in the region before setting your sights on Austria itself; capture Klagenfurt and your forces will have a clear path to Vienna. The stronghold of Mantua may prove to be a challenging obstacle, although its seizure is vital if you hope to weaken the Austrian position in Italy. You will also face resistance from Austria’s Coalition ally, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. Subjugating this nation, along with any other Italian states that stand in your way, will ensure you sufficient resources to crush the Austrians and overthrow the Coalition once and for all.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_British_Dragoon_Guards	\\n\\nDragoon Guards are trained to fight on horseback and foot. They each carry a sabre and carbine musket but are only capable of firing when dismounted. Their slightly impetuous nature makes them less effective than other more disciplined cavalry units but their flexibility and skill in close-combat makes them incredibly valuable. Having the option to unleash these men at key strategic points on the field of battle can easily provide the upper hand over an ill-prepared enemy.\\n\\nDragoons were often considered to be inferior soldiers by “proper” regiments of horse: not really cavalrymen with class, but jumped-up infantry. They did not need particularly good horses because they did not fight on horseback, so they were cheaper to equip and pay than regular cavalry. In the British Army the designation “dragoon guards” was used as a face-saving measure when “real” cavalry units were converted to dragoons; despite becoming a lower class unit, they kept their slightly elitist cavalry attitudes. The British Army still has dragoon guard units and they now use light tanks in reconnaissance and security roles.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tEducation2_university_spain	\\n\\nA university offers young men from good families a fine education, and the chance to study the greatest achievements of mankind. As a result there is a chance that, each turn, this university may produce a gentleman, a useful agent for his nation. The faculty also aids research into new technologies, but may produce a wish for reform among the people; even though the university is socially conservative, it cannot keep all progressive thoughts away from its students.\\n\\nA good education was useful for those who wished to make their way in the world using talent as well as family connections. A young gentleman’s studies were wide ranging, and not tied to any particular subject area: an awarded degree or doctorate was proof enough of some intellectual achievement. Historically, the established church in many countries had established the universities, and continued to run them. This meant that the university as a body rarely challenged the established order of things; the teachers and students both had vested interests in the status quo. While wild, threatening ideas about the world and the way it should work did emerge, the universities were rarely radical or revolutionary breeding grounds.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Small_French_Corvette	\\n\\nTheir size makes them ideal as a “skirmisher” against sloops and brigs, as they have the speed to keep up and the cannon range to do damage. They will not last long, however, against a larger vessel such as a ship-of-the-line: one broadside at close range from a rated ship would likely dash any corvette to pieces.\\n\\nCorvettes were a two-masted, French design for a ship very similar to a sloop-of-war; slightly smaller than a frigate with only a single gun deck. Like many French vessels, they were well thought out and beautifully constructed, with good sea-handling characteristics. Corvettes were ideal for the inshore waters along the English Channel where good sailing qualities were required. Other nations counted themselves fortunate if they took a French-built corvette as a prize. The term “corvette” was revived by many navies a century later for smaller warships. Indeed, a large number of modern navies use "corvette captain" (Korvettenkapitän, for example, in the Deutsche Marine) as a rank title, one step-up from lieutenant, indicating an officer suitable for an independent command.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rTimber3_steam_powered_sawmill_european	\\n\\nThe advent of steam power means that sawmills are no longer tied to watercourses for their power and they can be built anywhere, thus improving productivity. A sawmill also makes a considerable contribution to the industrial wealth of a region. However, working conditions are not very good, and the lower classes are unhappy as a result.\\n\\nThe invention of machine tools greatly improved the productivity of sawmills. The invention of the circular saw and gang saws meant that a tree could be turned into planks in one easy step. Both of these inventions were prone to breaking down: the circular saw was easily damaged by overheating or dirty logs. The expensive nature of this equipment led to the creation of a new sawmill technician known as a saw filer. These men were highly skilled in metalwork and their primary task was to keep the saws in perfect working order. High speed saws are not the safest pieces of industrial equipment to work near, and deaths and injuries were common.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tSupply3_supply_depot_european	\\n\\nGood generals understand that fighting battles is only a small part of military affairs. Equally important to success is in keeping an army healthy, supplied, and capable. To do this requires organisation and, above all, a good supply corps: a soldier without ammunition might as well not have stayed at home as come to the battlefield.\\n\\nPart of Napoleon’s genius for military affairs lay in his ability to take existing systems and make them work at full efficiency. His armies simply could not have functioned without a supply system, even though French armies were also much given to plundering, looting, and terrible depredations on foreign civil populations, all in the name of foraging. Stripping a country of everything might feed the men, but it could not provide the purely military supplies that they required: ammunition, powder, and uniforms, even boots. Huge stocks of matériel were required for any army, even one that did not fight, as life in the field wore out everything! Foraging only worked in relatively prosperous lands; one of the reasons that the invasion of Russia ended in disaster was that the Russians themselves destroyed everything in the French path, rather than let them have it.	false

start_pos_factions_description_1241624861	The new, revolutionary Republic of France is under threat from all the old reactionary nations of Europe! It is clear that there are no options other than war, and that the utter ruination of France is the only aim of Austria and France’s other enemies. The Austrians are motivated by fear: they fear their own people will follow the same revolutionary path.\\n\\nThe Austrians can be confronted in Germany and northern Italy. Austria’s possessions in Italy are ready for liberation! The other states of Italy bear watching, but should not be able to stand against the righteous anger of the French people!\\n\\nGeneral “Napoleone Buonaparte”, in charge of the Army of Italy’s artillery, has been appointed to command the entire army. It is his duty to hold onto France’s territory in the Italian peninsular. This is, however, an ambitious and skilful man and he has plans to drive the Austrians out of Italy and back to the gates of Vienna.	false

start_pos_factions_description_1920052109	Behind all the Imperial façade and republican sentiments, France is once again an absolute monarchy, now ruled by Emperor Napoleon I. His efforts to secure good marriages for his brothers and marshals are dynastic politics that Bourbon kings would have grasped instantly. Yet, for all this, the French people have freedom, as Napoleon has used credit gained by his victories to remake France. Merit, as well as birth, now counts for something.\\n\\nThe Emperor’s efforts have given France an impressive empire and domination over many neighbours; he is a source of strength. Napoleon has redrawn the map of Europe to suit his own ends. He is also a great weakness, as his treatment of enemies and rivals has not been entirely politic or polite. He has caused offence to nearly everyone, taking not giving, even when he should have been conciliatory. He has managed, through poor diplomacy, to make the British look like attractive allies to many.\\n\\nAs a result, the Austrians are waiting for an opportunity to strike back at France for their recent humiliations and losses. The Russians, too, will strike down this new upstart emperor if given a chance, and will they ignore Napoleon’s instructions to ban trade with England? The Prussians, apparently, are content to sit and wait, but for how long? Will they idly sit by if it becomes necessary to extend French power in northern Germany? And then there are the British: always there are the British. That vindictive little island will have to be dealt with at some time.\\n\\nFrance, therefore, faces many rivals. But if they can be isolated and removed one by one, then Europe really will know peace, under Bonaparte, the heir to Caesar!	false

technologies_long_description_military3_field_ambulances	\\n\\n Field ambulances are fast carts that can be driven into the thick of battle. Stocked with water, bandages, and other medical supplies they allow some treatment to be given immediately. More importantly, the wounded can be carried to the rear where a surgeon can give much needed medical attention. Surgery, however, remains close to butchery. Being able to provide this swift assistance means that the replenishment rate of units is improved.\\n\\n Historically, ambulances in their basic form have been around for centuries, Roman centurions were followed into battle by teams of strong men who would retrieve the wounded or dying. However, it was not until the Napoleonic Wars that the term “ambulance” was first used. The chief physician to Napoleon, Baron Jean Dominique Larrey (1766 – 1842) introduced a contraption he called the “ambulances volantes”. Outraged by the fact that the wounded and dying were not collected until after a battle, he adapted horse artillery caissons to carry the wounded for treatment at high speed. He eventually developed two varieties of carts that could be taken onto the battlefield to retrieve and treat injured soldiers.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tSecret2_secret_society_european	\\n\\nThe business of secret societies is, well, secret. What goes on behind their closed doors and in hidden chambers is a mystery, wrapped in misdirection and cloaked in falsehood. This building supports a number of spies and increases the chance that a spy may be produced each turn. It also has a positive effect on the happiness of all classes: who knows who might be watching, or listening? Surely it is better to be happy than attract unwelcome attention with frowns!\\n\\nSecret societies have always attracted a good deal of attention because of their secrecy, and many have been accused of conspiracies to do everything, from running a single country to running the whole world. Thanks to the secrecy of the Masons, they have often been suspected of many nefarious activities. A typical “secret” society founded in the early 19th Century is American: the “Skull and Bones Society”, set up by Yale University students. Its secrecy probably owed more to a desire not to have parents and university officials know just how much drinking was going on, but in recent years it has been the subject of many conspiracy theories. In 2007 the American CIA felt it necessary to deny rumours that it owed its establishment to a cabal of Skull and Bones members!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_British_Horse_Guards	\\n\\nIt is the task of the heavy cavalry to break the enemy by shock and impact. Simply put, the Horse Guards are expected to charge home and smash enemy ranks through weight and speed. They are not for chasing down enemies: that is the work of faster, lighter cavalry forces. Instead, they are a battering ram, hurled over short distances against close-formed enemies in the hope of producing a breakthrough and utter consternation. Thanks to being part of the royal household guard, these cavalrymen also lend a touch of class to the brutal business of a cavalry charge!\\n\\nHistorically, the Horse Guards Parade in London was the setting for “Trooping of the Colour”, a practice that dates back to the 17th Century. A regiment’s colours were a rallying point on the battlefield and so they were shown to the soldiers beforehand, in order that they would be recognised in battle. Today, the ceremony is used to celebrate the official birthday of the ruling monarch; at the time of writing Queen Elizabeth attends every year and takes the salute at the end of the parade.	false

Their steeds are fast and carry them to key points on the battlefield in what seems like a heartbeat. The morale of these brave men is unrivalled, but should they become caught in a prolonged melee their weakness in close combat will become apparent. Employed against elite infantry formed in square their charge and lance skills will be largely wasted.\\n\\nThe Polish Guard were originally raised from among a party of exiled Polish noblemen who accompanied Napoleon into Warsaw in 1807. He was so impressed with the loyalty of these men that he insisted the new regiment be attached to his own Imperial Guard. From that moment on candidates for the regiment had to be Polish landowners between the ages of 18 and 40; they were expected to provide their own horses and equipment. It wasn’t until after the Battle of Wagram in 1809 that these men were issued with the lance as standard equipment. When Napoleon was forced exiled on Elba in 1814, 150 loyalists of the Polish Guard Lancers followed their Emperor to prison.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_fFort3_star_fort_european	\\n\\nThe layout of the star fort, with its projecting bastions, creates fields of flanking fire to destroy attackers as they approach over the sloping glacis. In theory, no attacker should reach the wall without coming under sustained and murderous fire. The star shape evolved so that no part of the approaches would be “blind” to fire from somewhere within the fort. The whole structure is, in fact, one massive killing field for the defenders.\\n\\nIn the Medieval period, castles had relied on high walls to make them impregnable and to give them a sense of overwhelming grandeur – part of their purpose was simply to intimidate lesser men. With the advent of gunpowder artillery, a different defensive scheme was required. Fortifications sank into the ground, protected by enormously thick walls, deep counterscarps and a sloping bank or glacis that would, hopefully, cause cannon shots to ricochet over the defences rather than penetrate.	false
start_pos_factions_description_1201870394	Russia is a giant, if it can be mobilised to face the deadly danger to peace that is Napoleon Bonaparte.\\n\\nIt is also a nation that is recovering from the assassination of the reforming Tsar Paul in 1801, a man who was too interested in reform to be left on the throne. Rumour has it that Tsar Alexander was complicit, at the very least, in his father’s death. Paul had taken Russia to war against revolutionary France. Now Alexander is beginning to realise that a French, or rather, Napoleonic hunger for victories will drag Russia into war once again. If Russia is to be seen as a major power in Europe, she must behave as a major power, or accept French domination of Europe.\\n\\nThis is why Russia now contemplates war against France again. There may be incidental gains to be made in Poland and Prussian-dominated Germany, but the threat of the new French Empire is real. Napoleon has set himself up as the equal of the Tsar, and that is an implicit challenge. There are potential allies and some, like the English, have very large treasuries.\\n\\nRussian soldiers may be rough and ready, but her generals are cunning commanders. Russia also has the advantage of time and space, should a war go badly. No invader from the west can comprehend the emptiness of the steppes, deal with the vast distances of Russia, or survive the merciless campaigns of “General Winter”.	false

technologies_long_description_military4_modern_rifles	\\n\\nRifles must be used by specialists to achieve effectiveness on the battlefield; this is why they are usually only issued to specially-selected and highly-trained units of skirmishers. The difference between a rifle and a smoothbore musket is in the grooves cut into the barrel: these give a spin to the ball as it is fired, making it more accurate over long ranges. However, loading a shot requires care and attention in battle, and a rifle needs care and attention to keep it clean and properly adjusted after a fight.\\n\\nIn 1800, the British Army established the Experimental Corps of Rifles in Horsham, Sussex. Selected men were drafted from various regiments and trained to think independently as well as fight as skirmishers. They were equipped with Ezekiel Baker’s flintlock rifle, a splendidly accurate weapon. It was not unknown for riflemen to hold targets for each other, a demonstration that would have been suicidal and stupid if the firer had been using a standard Brown Bess musket. Clad in green uniforms, Rifles, as the Baker-armed soldiers were soon called, were justly respected.	false

technologies_long_description_military3_auxiliary_discount	\\n\\nEmphasising the prestige and honour gained through military service will make enlistment appear desirable. Men can be recruited from the local people of the battle area, and trained to fight as auxiliary regiments. If the appeal to join the colours is pitched correctly, many will join up to protect their homes and country. Funding, training officers and weapons will still have to be found, of course, but this is cheaper and easier than transporting troops from home.\\n\\nDuring the Peninsular War, British forces fought alongside Portuguese regiments, holding them in high regard. Portugal did have a longstanding alliance with Britain, and flourishing trade links. Napoleon’s invasion sparked mass revolts by loyal Portuguese people. Britain was able to capitalise on Portuguese hatred of the French by supplying arms, equipment and officers. The Portuguese provided the men, and created British-style line regiments, complete with Portuguese bravado and a desire to “have at the French."	false

technologies_long_description_admin1_abolition_of_the_inquisition	\\n\\nThe once powerful Inquisition no longer has the hold over the hearts of the Catholic faithful that it once did. France’s removal of its power in areas under their control does much to reduce unrest. The French may be disliked, but the Inquisition was always feared, because no man could ever consider himself truly safe from its attentions. The Inquisition’s purpose of hunting out heresy and wrong thinking has done much to hold back the influence of the Enlightenment, and much to make Spain a very conservative society.\\n\\nHistorically, Spain always had a strong Catholic identity after the Reconquista, and the Inquisition was charged with investigating and rooting out anyone who would threaten the Catholic faith. When Napoleon placed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, upon the throne, he quickly set about making drastic changes to bring Spain into line with France’s rules. Apart from abolishing the Inquisition, he also introduced other progressive reforms to improve the life of Spanish civilians. While welcome in France, the reforms had a mixed reception in Spain. The passing of the feared Inquisition was not widely mourned.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Militia_Prussian_Landwehr	\\n\\nThey are also equal to the job of quelling troublesome civilians, but their lack of training means that they should not be expected to fight as well as regular soldiers. These are the people-in-arms, not a hardened force of veterans. Against well-handled and disciplined soldiers, they will suffer heavy losses. They are, however, a useful force of garrison troops, and can help keep order at relatively low cost.\\n\\nIn 1812 Prussia had been compelled to aid Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. General Yorck, the officer in charge of the Prussian Auxiliary Corps, was a well-respected patriot, and an experienced soldier. It was obvious to him that the French were going to be defeated, so he declared his corps neutral and aided the Russians in taking East Prussia. As East Prussia, if not the whole country, was at war with France, an army was needed to defend it and the result was the recruitment of a large body of Landwehr militia. Yorck’s decision to defy the French produced the Russo-Prussian alliance of 1813, a significant bloc against Napoleon’s France.	false

events_event_text_davy_lamp	The chemist and inventor Sir Humphrey Davy has designed a new mining lamp designed to improve safety in coal mines. Whereas previously a naked flame would ignite any flammable gases present at the coalface, Davy’s innovation of a wire mesh between the candle and the open air allows combustion to occur but not escape due to a very fine mesh separating the two. The new lamp also acts as a means of detecting potentially dangerous gases, as the flame increases in size or extinguishes when insufficient oxygen is present.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the invention of a similar lamp by George Stephenson has led to accusations of plagiarism from supporters of the rival inventors, and there are still critical safety issues to be resolved for both designs. For instance, a Davy Lamp can become too hot in the presence of a large quantity of methane, and the overall quality of illumination is poor. Despite these negative factors, the new lamp is simple to construct and cheap to manufacture - something that will surely strike a chord with mine owners everywhere.	false

Although their experience in battle means they have good firepower, the Jägers’ flexibility as a unit has its disadvantages. They are not as accurate as other skirmishers and will not always beat enemy line infantry when firing in volley. They also lack the ability to form square, which leaves them vulnerable to cavalry charges.\\n\\nDuring 1804-1813, Russia was fighting on two fronts: holding off Napoleon’s troops and fighting a war for territory against the Persians. The Russo-Persian War was an attempt by both sides to consolidate their claims to the same land. Russia was attempting to expand the empire and Persia was attempting to hold on to lands they always considered their own. Because the Russians were also committed against the French, they could not provide a large force to fight the Persians, and instead had to rely on superior technology and tactics to gain an advantage.	false

Although the majority of the population is Hindu, their Muslim rulers will be trying to convert as many people as possible across the land. Prevent large-scale conversion by assassinating their Imam teachers if you can. Sending thugees to their cities will give you intelligence about Mughal forces. European powers have begun to show interest in India for the trade wealth they know they can obtain.

start_pos_factions_description_1538105622	Prussia has a proud military heritage: what else could be the case for the nation of Frederick the Great? The country has been at peace for ten years, the result of getting a free hand in northern Germany east of the Rhine in exchange for recognising French control west of the Rhine. Political realities have to be recognised. Napoleon, however, is not an easy neighbour to endure. His ambitions are seemingly limitless, his army is growing every day, and he is in need of new victories to add lustre and legitimacy to his crown. It may only be a matter of time before he once again looks to secure the borders of France through war. Perhaps, though, he can be persuaded to go south, against Austria, even if that only leaves a stronger France to face at a later date. There are allies available, if the Prussians can stomach them. The British are condescending and unwilling to fight on land, but they have the wealth needed to finance a war. The Russians and Austrians may be willing to help bring down the upstart empire of Napoleon, even as they will do their best to hamper Prussian ambitions. Neither the Austrians nor the Russians have any wish to see Germany or Poland dominated by Prussia, even as they prepare for war against France. Such then, is the situation facing Frederick William III. Danger and opportunity await.	false

An artillery fort therefore requires a lot of timber for bracing, and a considerable amount of manual work to create the required earthworks. These do make the structure better able to resist bombardment by attackers, but no timber structure, even one backed by earthen banks, can stand forever against artillery. \\n\\nA wooden artillery fort commands the surrounding landscape, and is a significant strategic obstacle to any invading force. Its imposing walls also give notice that its builders intend to keep the land they have occupied.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_2_Decker_74	\\n\\nThe 74 is a supremely practical naval weapon and regarded as the best balance between defensive strength and manoeuvrability. A two-deck design, it is strong enough to mount very heavy 32-pounder cannons on its lower gun deck. These, when combined with the upper deck’s 18-pounders, give it a devastating broadside, although this is best delivered at close quarters.\\n\\nThe French developed the 74-gun ship concept in the mid-18th Century. The design was so good that other navies lost no time in copying it for themselves or taking French ships in action. Many French vessels were made from green timber that “worked” in heavy seas and therefore leaked; the French accepted this because they believed the green timber made the ships resilient. British 74s were well built too, although there was a regrettable tendency to save money by recycling timbers, along with their woodworm and rot, from older vessels!\\n\\nThe last 74, HMS Implacable, was finally scuttled in 1949! Built in 1800 by the French, and then captured by the British at Trafalgar in 1805, she stayed in active service until 1842. She ended her days as a coal hulk.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_British_95th_Rifles	\\n\\nThe flintlock rifles these men carry have an astonishing range and accuracy. Their skirmishing abilities allow them to use whatever cover is available to hide, stalk enemies, and then kill them at great distances. In an age of military peacocks, their uniforms are a dark, subdued colour to help them in their role as hunters. They are, however, not invulnerable. Like all skirmishers, they can be cut down by a carefully organised cavalry attack. They will also suffer if exposed to volleys from a line unit.\\n\\nThe 95th Rifles started in 1800 as the Experimental Corps of Riflemen in Horsham, Sussex (co-incidentally, the developers of this game are based in the same town). Unlike the rest of the British army, who sported the famous red coat, riflemen wore a distinctive dark green jacket, the first British attempt at camouflage. A good rifleman was expected to think for himself; if he could not read, he was taught, in order to give him a fair chance at promotion. The class distinctions between officers and men still existed in “the Rifles” but trust and respect were emphasised: officers, for example, regularly dined with their men. Officers were also expected to become marksmen at least as expert as their soldiers.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sRoads2_improved_roads_european	\\n\\nMaking a cobbled road is an incredibly laborious business. Each small paving stone must be shaped, placed and mortared into position. If done properly, the road also requires foundations, a carefully judged camber to carry away rainwater, and drainage. The end result is a fine road that is extremely durable, but not very comfortable: cobbles can be hellishly bumpy!\\n\\nIn practice the expense of cobbling a road, and the attractive finish that cobbles produced, meant that the surface was only used where the nobility or propertied classes were likely to see or use it. The great and the good could hardly be expected to wallow along in the mud and horse dung like common folk! The poor did, however, find a use for cobbles: lifted from the road, they were a perfect fist-sized lump of rock for hurling at the unpopular representatives of law and order. In his later years, the Duke of Wellington, by then the British Prime Minister, was not called the “Iron Duke” for his military qualities, but thanks to his carriage’s iron shutters, there to protect him from the many rocks that were chucked in his direction!	false

start_pos_factions_description_-487488841	Behind all the Imperial façade and republican sentiments, France is once again an absolute monarchy, now ruled by Emperor Napoleon I. His efforts to secure good marriages for his brothers and marshals are dynastic politics that Bourbon kings would have grasped instantly. Yet, for all this, the French people have freedom, as Napoleon has used credit gained by his victories to remake France. Merit, as well as birth, now counts for something.\\n\\nThe Emperor’s efforts have given France an impressive empire and domination over many neighbours; he is a source of strength. Napoleon has redrawn the map of Europe to suit his own ends. He is also a great weakness, as his treatment of enemies and rivals has not been entirely politic or polite. He has caused offence to nearly everyone, taking not giving, even when he should have been conciliatory. He has managed, through poor diplomacy, to make the British look like attractive allies to many.\\n\\nAs a result, the Austrians are waiting for an opportunity to strike back at France for their recent humiliations and losses. The Russians, too, will strike down this new upstart emperor if given a chance, and will they ignore Napoleon’s instructions to ban trade with England? The Prussians, apparently, are content to sit and wait, but for how long? Will they idly sit by if it becomes necessary to extend French power in northern Germany? And then there are the British: always there are the British. That vindictive little island will have to be dealt with at some time.\\n\\nFrance, therefore, faces many rivals. But if they can be isolated and removed one by one, then Europe really will know peace, under Bonaparte, the heir to Caesar!	false

Once their initial charge has shaken the enemy, this unit can then engage in close combat, hacking with their straight heavy swords at anyone unfortunate to still be alive. Though powerful, they are still at a disadvantage against elite infantry and almost any infantry properly formed up in a square.\\n\\nHistorically, French cavalry were considered among the best during the Napoleonic Wars, despite the French not necessarily having the best individual horsemen. Instead, French cavalry strength lay in the organisation and strict discipline of the regiments. On the battlefield, the French often had remounts ready to take the place of fallen horses. Regiments were trained well enough, and expected, to change formations and strategic positions on the battlefield as and when required.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_2_Decker_64	\\n\\nThe 64-gun ship may lack some of the firepower of the other ships-of-the-line, but it still has a respectable broadside, and can be constructed at a lower cost. It can be regarded as a stepping stone between 50- and 74-gun ships, with more broadside weight than the first yet with a faster reloading time than the second thanks to its lighter cannons. Opinions differ as to whether this is a happy compromise.\\n\\nThe Royal Navy classed a 64-gun ship as a “third rate” ship, normally a classification reserved for 74-gun ships. Although small, the 64 was not without supporters: Captain Horatio Nelson’s favourite ship was HMS Agamemnon, a 64 built at Bucklers Hard in the New Forest. His crew, often called Agamemnons, loyally followed Nelson to his subsequent ships and successes. The Agamemnon itself was used by the Royal Navy during the American and French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic War and was at the Battle of Trafalgar. After nearly 30 years of hard service it ran aground off South America, but the entire crew survived the wreck. The "Eggs and Bacon", as the crew called it, looked after its men to the last.	false

events_event_text_stock_exchange_hoax	A fraudulent hoax has been uncovered in Great Britain when the circulation of news claiming that Napoleon had been defeated caused an artificial increase in the value of government bonds.\\n\\nOn February 21st a man calling himself Colonel du Borg visited every inn between Dover and London, claiming that the French Emperor had been killed and France’s deposed royal family restored to the throne. Later in the day, a coach containing three French officers rode around London distributing leaflets confirming the story. By the afternoon it had been revealed as a hoax, but by that point the value of government stock had risen sufficiently for the perpetrators to make a grand profit from the sale of those shares.\\n\\nSuspecting fraud, the Committee of the Stock Exchange immediately launched an investigation into the affair - concluding that a substantial purchase completed one week earlier was definitely connected to the fraud. The three men responsible now stand convicted of the crime. Controversially, one of them happens to be the naval hero Lord Cochrane, and many have reasoned that a man with such a record of bravery must surely be innocent of the charges against him. However, despite the public outcry he has been stripped of his rank and expelled from the Order of the Bath. Cochrane has protested his innocence in the strongest possible terms, and we can be assured that the matter will not rest there.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCulture5_British_National_Gallery	\\n\\nPride in one’s nation is a powerful thing, and what better way to instil national pride than to build a structure that celebrates the great achievements of the country? Be it past victories, advances in education and technology, or a collection of treasures, such structures provide a stage to display achievements to the world. National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\\n\\nHistorically, the British National Gallery came into being when the government bought the art collection of English banker, John Julius Angerstein. The collection was originally housed in Angerstein’s home in Pall Mall in central London, but this was seen as far too small in comparison with other national galleries. The government agreed to fund the construction of a new building and Trafalgar Square was chosen as the best location. The construction of the National Gallery was completed in 1838 and the amazing collection remains open to the public.	false

technologies_long_description_military1_partisan_muskets	\\n\\nAs more Spaniards arm themselves and dedicate themselves to the cause, you will receive an additional guerrilla unit for every region you liberate from French rule. Guerrillas cannot rely only on their own hunting rifles or plundered enemy weapons. If they are to be a truly valuable force, they will need military-pattern muskets as well for closer engagements. A good supply system will keep them equipped with reliable firearms so they can fight.\\n\\nHistorically, Britain supplied guerrilla bands with relatively few weapons when compared to their supply of the regular Spanish Army. Though the British held some reservations about the Spanish Army and its officers, the guerrilla bands were a new phenomenon and regarded with some suspicion as little better than bandits by socially conservative British commanders. Supplies of clothes and ammunition were sent to the northern Spanish coast, and other weapons were taken from fallen enemies. Despite fighting as allies, both Spain and Britain were wary of each other because of their long mutual history of conflict.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tFactory3_steam_powered_factory_european	\\n\\nSteam power allows factories to be built away from rivers, because water wheels are no longer a limit on where they can be built. This opens up large areas of countryside that had previously been unsuitable for mills and factories. However, such industrialisation makes the lower classes miserable, due to their harsh working and living conditions.\\n\\nHistorically, the introduction of steam power to industry in the 19th century did change the way that mills and factories worked. It was no longer necessary to build them in valleys, where rivers could be diverted for power. A central boiler house and engine shed provided all the power, and this was fed into the rest of the factory through drive shafts and belts. It became increasingly dangerous to work in factories, as the machinery itself could now be operated at a much higher speed. Accidents were nearly always blamed on the workers, who received no compensation for any injuries or deaths. Some factory owners stopped wages for everyone when there was an accident, because they made no profits while machinery was being cleared of blood and body parts.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_Count_von_Bennigsen	\\n\\nThis commander’s presence alone is enough to inspire battle-weary troops to fight on, even in the bleakest of situations. A general who carries the respect and adoration of his troops is a valuable asset and should be treasured. It is advisable to keep this man away from the thick of battle, not only for his protection but to allow him to keep a cool head and make the necessary decisions to win a decisive victory.\\n\\nCount von Bennigsen started his military career in the Hanoverian army but soon retired and then joined the Russian army as a field officer. Although Bennigsen led a distinguished career in the Russian army, rising quickly through the ranks, he was removed from military service due to his involvement in the plot to assassinate Tsar Paul I. This seemed of little consequence to the Tsar’s heir, Alexander I, who reinstated Bennigsen immediately after his father’s death and made him a general of cavalry in 1802. He was later awarded the Order of St. Andrew, the highest order bestowed by the Russian empire.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_2_Decker_50	\\n\\nShips-of-the-line are the mainstay of fighting fleets; they are strong and stable gun platforms for battering enemy fleets to pieces. A 50-gun ship-of-the-line is a square-rigged, two-deck vessel, carrying two calibres of cannon: 24- and 18-pounders, with the heavier guns mounted on the lower deck. Though cheap compared to other two-deck warships, their broadside is still effective at close range, and best employed against frigates and smaller craft. A 50-gun ship should not be expected to last long in combat against larger battleships.\\n\\nBy the 1750s it was obvious that 50-gun ships lacked the hull strength and firepower to stand in the line of battle against larger vessels. Because of their size, there was a new production of British 50-gun ships to serve in shallow coastal waters during the American Revolution but, apart from this, their usefulness in battle was largely over. Various national admiralties removed these small battle ships from active service, or sent them to minor overseas stations where they were unlikely to encounter powerful enemies. Some survived as converted troop transports.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_madrassa	\\n\\nThese schools are often attached to mosques, but they do not offer religious instruction alone. Those who wish to do so may study the Qur’an, and become honoured as a “hafiz” when they have memorised the whole text. Others may choose a wider syllabus and learn additional subjects such as history, logic, Shari’ah law, the Hadith – the recorded sayings and deeds of the Prophet, peace be upon him – and correct interpretation of the Qur’an. Those who finish their studies will gain status as scholars and imams, and become leaders in the wider community expected to interpret the law and religion for their fellow Muslims.\\nHistorically, some madrassas offered their pupils an even wider choice of subjects, including Arabic literature, English, French, Dutch and other useful trade languages as well as science, mathematics and world history. The scholars produced were intellectually rounded individuals, often better prepared for later studies than the counterparts in Europe. There were even madrassas that specialised as medical schools.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_ottomans_nur-u_osmaniye_mosque	\\n\\nIt is designed in a style that was extremely popular in the Ottoman Empire of the 1700s, and was ordered by Sultan Mahmud I in 1748. Unfortunately for him, it was only completed in the reign of Sultan Osman III in 1755, and is probably the most significant achievement of that particular sultan. The name of the mosque, “Light of Osman” commemorates his efforts in financing this superb, light, airy building with its many windows.\\n\\nBy most standards (even those of an 18th Century absolute monarch) Osman was a little odd. He was notably intolerant towards non-Muslims and generally regarded as a bit insignificant before he took the throne. He had lived much of his life within the palace as a prisoner. He loathed music, and banished every musician from his court. He also found the company of women extremely distasteful, having been imprisoned within the harem section of the palace. When he became Sultan he took to wearing iron shoes so that his approach would always be audible. Any women in the vicinity were expected to hear him coming, and then find somewhere to hide while he passed by. He was succeeded by Mustafa III, a better fellow and ruler by far.	false

start_pos_factions_description_-490503077	There are matters to be settled between the house of Hapsburg and the upstart Bonaparte.\\n\\nFrancis I is the first Hapsburg monarch to use the title Emperor of Austria. His ancient possessions in the Holy Roman Empire have been largely stripped away by a series of military disasters inflicted by the "Emperor" Napoleon. The old Empire is no more. In Italy and Germany, General Bonaparte personally oversaw military campaigns that broke Austrian Hapsburg dominance. Despite a relatively generous peace settlement in 1801, the Hapsburg throne lost too much.\\n\\nFrance remains a threat: it is unlikely that Napoleon can ever let matters rest as they are now. His legitimacy as a ruler is bought and paid for in military glory, and that cannot be won in times of peace. His attitude towards other nations is tinged with contempt at best, and hostility at worst. Austria, then, has to choose sides. Fortunately, there are potential allies in the Russians and the British. Indeed, the British may be ideal allies, for they are likely to want the return of Hanover, thus weakening Prussian power within Germany. They also have an exceptionally large amount of money to help finance their continental allies.\\n\\nThe Russians will expect to be compensated for any efforts against Napoleon by Polish territory, but Austria can put up with such an arrangement. The difficulty may lie in coming to an arrangement with Prussia: can Germany be divided equably? But there is much to be gained by finding allies: Austria needs help if she is to regain the lost lands of Italy and, finally, remove the revolutionary threat that is France.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Light_Light_Infantry	\\n\\nThese men are versatile soldiers: whether firing in a disciplined line or skirmishing in loose formation, they bring a good self-discipline and accuracy to the battle. They carry smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets, but do not rely on massed fire. Instead they aim at individuals within the enemy ranks, killing officers, sergeants and anyone else who takes charge. They also fight their own specialised battle, driving off enemy skirmishers. However, they may prove weak when pitted against line infantry or highly expert skirmishers such as riflemen.\\n\\nBy the early 1800s, light infantry had a much greater role on the battlefield, at least in Napoleon’s forces. Many armies still saw light infantry as little more than auxiliary troops, choosing to favour the old, tried and tested tactics of massed volley fire and close formations. Napoleon, on the other hand, recognised the advantage flexibility conferred, and used light infantry extensively, to harass enemy lines to pieces, then closing up for a final rush.	false

Meanwhile, the Prussians have not joined your coalition, so their eastern territories could be absorbed to ensure they do not become a threat to you.

Although cavalrymen lead from the front, it is advisable to keep this man away from particularly dangerous fights, for his protection if nothing else.\\n\\nHenry Paget, the Earl of Uxbridge, later Marquis of Anglesey, was Wellington’s cavalry commander during the 1815 Waterloo campaign. This was not a comfortable arrangement for either of them, as Paget had proved himself to be something less than a gentleman by seducing, and running off with, the wife of Wellington’s youngest brother. This social gaffe put a bit of a crimp on what had been a distinguished military career as a cavalry leader. Nobody denied that Paget was courageous and skilful, but he was a cad and a bounder. He is also the man who had his leg shot off at Waterloo in the middle of a conversation with Wellington. It is not recorded whether their dry exchange of remarks: “By God, sir, I've lost my leg!” and “By God, sir, so you have!” was accompanied by an excusable smirk on Wellington’s behalf.	false

technologies_long_description_admin4_semaphore_lines	\\n\\nNews can travel along a semaphore system far faster than any postal system. Chains of towers are built across the countryside, so that each is visible to its neighbours. Operators use telescopes to watch their neighbouring towers, and messages are passed by setting the position of the tower’s arms or large moveable boards. Each combination of positions carries a meaning; once copied from a tower, the semaphore operator can repeat the message, sending it further down the line. In this fashion, news, even from distant frontiers, can be sent across a country in a matter of moments. The effect is to increase the line of sight around the borders of a nation’s territory.\\n\\nThe bonfire or beacon is, possibly, the simplest of message systems. It can carry one pre-arranged message when fired, usually something along the lines of “The enemy are coming!” By having a system that can send multiple messages, semaphore lines reduce the response time in any situation. Napoleon saw the worth of a semaphore system for keeping in touch; the British Admiralty invested much time and effort in constructing a system between all its major operational ports.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sFortifications1_settlement_fortifications_euro	\\n\\nThese fortifications cover the city approaches with artillery forts, protecting it from assault. The defences allow a settlement to hold out a little longer when under siege. The star shape evolved so that no part of the defences would be “blind” to fire from somewhere within the fort. The layout of projecting bastions in a star fort creates interlocking fields of fire to destroy attackers as they approach over the sloping glacis. Anyone approaching the fort can be shot at from several directions; no attacker should reach the wall without coming under sustained and murderous attack from the defenders. The whole structure is, in fact, one massive killing zone for artillery weapons and defensive musketry.\\n\\nHistorically, the most notable creator of star forts was the French military engineering genius, Marshal Vauban (1633-1707); his name is virtually synonymous with the design. Despite his designs being over 100 years old by the time of Napoleon, they were still fearsomely hard to take. His defences at Verdun were still considered good enough to be used by the French army during the epic siege in 1916, during the First World War.	false

In these times of trade with far away nations, a man can make a considerable living out of the earth and its bounty. Precious metals and stones can be traded in their raw state or used to make trade items such as jewellery or weapons.\\n\\nIt is thought that Native American tribes were mining as long ago as 900 AD. Grooved axes, mauls and anvils have been discovered dating back to this period showing that not only did the tribes know how to extract metal but also how to work it.	false

Unlike their comrades in the line and light infantry, they are mounted and can fight on foot if needed. They form up in a loose skirmish line, firing independently at their self-designated targets. The result is a constant barrage rather than a devastating volley, but a deadly one as officers and sergeants are removed from the fight.\\n\\nHistorically, Cazadores were trained to defend the border between Spain and Portugal, an area of much activity before and during the Peninsular War. In 1800, Napoleon and his Spanish ally, Manuel de Gordoy, demanded that Portugal ally with France. This was something that Portugal, a long-standing ally of the British, refused to do. In 1801 French and Spanish troops under Gordoy took the Portuguese town of Olivenza. Once the fighting was over, Gordoy picked oranges from a nearby grove and sent them back to the Queen to inform her of his victory, giving the affair the title of “The War of the Oranges”.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_theatre_european	\\n\\nA night at the theatre is a bawdy, rambunctious, rowdy, exciting, and novel experience. The theatre holds up a mirror to society, and sometimes society does not like what it sees. The audience show little respect, heckling is an art, and performers play to their claques rather than follow the text. Yet each great performance, each actor-manager, each new work, is eagerly followed by the chattering classes.\\n\\nHistorically, theatres could mean a great deal of trouble for the authorities. Riots were not uncommon if unpopular or provocative plays were staged, and David Garrick, the leading light of the London stage, was forced to kneel in apology before a fickle audience he had offended. They were in the process of completely wrecking his theatre and his livelihood! Because of this public excitability, and the potential for subversive propaganda, in the interests of “public morality” all governments closely monitored theatre performances. Indeed, Great Britain only scrapped censorship of theatres in 1968 when the Lord Chancellor’s Office no longer required London theatres to have approval for every production.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_986712698	The Emperor’s mission to bring the revolution to the European masses has not been an easy task in the Spanish Peninsula. France’s attempts to annex Portugal have led to Great Britain’s involvement in the liberation of their ancient ally. Although largely having failed in their attempts to capture territory from us, and with their original commander slain in battle, Great Britain, under the command of Viscount Wellington and with the aid of a complex fort system guarding the approaches to the capital, are pushing French forces out of Portugal for the second time. With your armies in retreat it is now time to consolidate your efforts to repel Wellington’s British army as they land and head into Spain, so control of coastal regions is vital to prevent further landings. Meanwhile, the Spanish resistance is in full-swing; your armies will continue to be harassed by the cowardly “guerrilla” bands and their hit-and-run tactics. They must be stamped out - their presence is damaging to army morale, troop numbers and France’s attempt to bring enlightened government to the Peninsula; they must be crushed without exception and without mercy. Of course, there is also another war to be won in the Peninsula; although many Spanish people in the centre of the country support the revolution, priests continue to speak out against the Emperor from the pulpit, so it is vital that your own provocateurs promote the ideals of the revolution and spread your propaganda in the outlying towns and cities.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Trade_Ship_Merchantmen	\\n\\nThis trade ship is neither blessed with speed nor firepower and can be outmanoeuvred by most naval vessels. It is built for trade, and its low upkeep costs mean a large profit from each journey. If trapped it can defend itself slightly and maybe even drive off very weak attackers, but merchants are not fighting men, and their low morale and the ship’s light guns are unlikely to last long against a real warship.\\n\\nBritish merchant trading was the strongest in the world during the Napoleonic era, and this position was protected by the Navigation Acts first passed in 1651. Trade with British colonies had to be carried out using “British bottoms” or British ships, not to mention British ports and mainly British crews, effectively squeezing out any competition. Other nations tried similar protectionist policies, but without as much success. Despite this legal help, British merchant owners were not without their difficulties; the Royal Navy used press gangs to recruit seamen for the ranks and experienced merchant sailors were the first to be targeted, forcing merchant owners to pay high wages for less able seamen simply to run their ships.	false

start_pos_factions_description_-511586035	Great Britain and Portugal have been allies since medieval times. When Napoleon invaded Portugal after its refusal to obey his embargo orders on trade with Great Britain, the result was a foregone conclusion. British troops arrived in Portugal and the Royal Navy spirited away the entire Portuguese court before the French could reach Lisbon. With Napoleon and his Grande Armée otherwise occupied, this far-flung corner of Europe was an opportunity for the British to deal a blow to the Corsican Tyrant.\\n\\nWith the Lines of Torres Vedras now complete, Lisbon is safe behind a mighty fortress. This strong defensive position gives the British a superior base of operations in the Peninsula. Combined with the support of Spanish guerrillas and the Portuguese army, Britain stands a fair chance of driving the French from Spain altogether. However, Marshal Masséna must not be underestimated. He is a seasoned commander and will not give up without a hard fight. He has Napoleon’s trust for excellent reasons, and will use every asset under French control to the greatest advantage.\\n\\nBritain has challenges and opportunities in Spain. There is the chance to directly fight, and possibly beat, the French. But the army under Wellington is, for all intents, the only army that the British can field. Once it is gone, any chance of further land campaigns is also gone.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rGold1_gold_mine_european	\\n\\nNo one, however, cares about those, as the greed of men for gold seems to know no limits; even townsfolk uninvolved in the mine feel the benefit of the wealth produced. It is a dirty, dangerous business and the miners risk everything for the sake of the owner’s profits.\\n\\nHistorically, profits for owners were the only consideration in mines. Accidents were seen as inevitable and annoying, because they slowed down extraction. Miners were expected to work in terrible conditions, and paid piece rates for their work. Because safety work and shoring up tunnels did not earn money, the tasks were skipped. What point is there in working if you are not going to be paid? Pit props may stop tunnels collapsing, but putting them in is not paid work, and the miners may even be charged for the materials! Owners were quite willing to charge them for candles, tools and gunpowder. They were also willing to pay lower rates to women and child labourers too: women often pull carts to the surface and children need less space and air than adults.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_royal_observatory_european_gov_absolute_monarchy	\\n\\nThe study of the heavens leads to advances in mathematics, and improvements in scientific instrument making, horology and, perhaps most importantly of all, navigation and surveying. Accurate star charts and lunar tables (showing the phases of the moon) enable sailors to determine their position at sea, and a navy that can navigate accurately is one that can carry out its duties effectively. An observatory is also a centre for national prestige, as discoveries made and published reflect well on the institute and the nation that funds its work.\\n\\nHistorically, observatories were vital in the development of navigation and accurate clocks. This is why the zero-degree longitude line passes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London (until 1884 most states used their own nationalistic reference points). Indeed, the nationalism of astronomy often leads to ignorance of the observations and deductions of non-European astronomers.\\n\\nAstronomers could also be outrageous flatterers. After he discovered what he thought was a new planet, Sir William Herschel chose the name “Georgium Sidus”, or George’s Star, in a transparent bit of sucking up to his patron, King George III. Other astronomers flirted with the name “Herschel” then settled on “Uranus” for the new planet.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Lancer_Lifeguard_Cossacks	\\n\\nThese cavalry are among the fastest moving in any battle. They are equipped with lances, weapons best suited to the charge where their long reach can deliver the first strikes in any action. They are best when used charged and then withdrawn before prolonged close melee can develop, as in such fights a lance is ineffective and the cossacks will suffer unnecessary casualties. Despite their elite status, the lifeguard cossacks are fairly ill-disciplined, as might be expected of any cossacks! A good general does not use them to attack enemies in square formation, or disciplined elite infantry; their good qualities would count for little in either situation. \\n\\nWhile called “cossacks”, and listed as being Don or Black Sea cossack regiments, the historical cossack lifeguards do not seem to have been the usual rough-and-ready steppe horsemen. While dressed and equipped in cossack style, something that would intimidate foes quite successfully, many cossack lifeguards came from the regular Russian cavalry. This was little comfort to their foes: the men were selected on the basis of their physical toughness, size and bravery. This kind of selection policy was quite common in the Tsar’s army of the period. Enemies who fought against the “red” cossacks of the lifeguards commented that they were all strapping fellows, true cossacks or not, and complimented them on their wild courage in action.	false

The collection has a morbid, even prurient air to it, as it features a huge number of “natural curiosities” in the form of human and animal foetuses and still-births, all carefully preserved so that their details can be studied. The point, however, wasn’t simply to collect odd items for the sake of collecting oddities. Peter the Great wished to debunk the superstitions and fears of Russia which, even though he was the tsar, he regarded as backwards and ignorant.\\n\\nHe had little interest in collecting man-made objects, unlike the hunters and collectors of antiquities at other great museums of the time. Major collections of minerals, rocks and scientific instruments were added to the Kunstkamera (a word derived from Dutch).

Although primarily for the upper and middle classes, a Masonic lodge does improve the happiness of the lower classes. Perhaps they are pleased that their betters are too busy to be regularly horsewhipping them for impudence…\\n\\nThe first Grand Lodge of the Freemasons was established in England in 1717, when four lodges came together at the Goose and Gridiron Ale House in St Paul’s churchyard. Just a few years later in 1723 James Anderson wrote ‘The Constitutions of the Free-masons’, and laid out the rules by which the fraternity would be governed. In this document he traced the history of “the craft” all the way back to the Old Testament. Whatever its origins, Masonry spread across Europe with some rapidity during the Age of the Enlightenment, prompting warnings from the Catholic Church and suspicion from both revolutionaries and arch-conservatives.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_151876182	Your empire is in decline and the Marathas are rising - uniting their fellow Hindus against Mughal rule. As such, your priorities should be to stabilise your territory against rebellion, and build up your forces to withstand attacks from the increasingly strong Hindu forces in the southern regions of Carnatica and Mysore. Sending Muslim missionaries throughout your territory will help to convert the population. This will in turn greatly improve the public order situation and reduce the chances of rebellion. European powers have begun to show interest in India for the trade wealth they know they can obtain. The Portuguese and Dutch already have a foothold on Indian soil, and the British and French are close behind them. It may be prudent to maintain trade with foreigners, to ally with one or the other for mutual benefit, or to drive them out of Mughal lands altogether.

technologies_long_description_admin5_homeland_recruitment	\\n\\nFighting for your country, winning glory and honour, wearing a smart uniform, and attracting the ladies are all good reasons to “take the colours” and join an army. The promise of regular meals might also help. There are, of course, genuine patriots among the lower social orders, but many traditional jobs are disappearing as new factories appear in towns, and working men must do something if they are to eat. Harnessing them to the army is one solution.\\n\\nIn Britain at least there were some safeguards to prevent men being kidnapped by unscrupulous recruiting parties. A man would have to accept the “King’s Shilling”, a nominal sum of money that was part of his signing bounty. Accounts that the shilling would be passed over in drinks to half-drunken recruits as an elaborate game of tag are later exaggerations. Recruits knew that they would be offered the shilling, along with a drink or two, but they didn’t have to accept. Recruiters weren’t above embroidering the truth about army life, particularly on the subject of riches to be won, but recruits did have to go before a magistrate to attest that they were joining the army. A recruiter who returned to his regiment with too many resentful, hung-over, potential deserters would not be thanked for his pains.	false

technologies_long_description_military1_fire_and_advance	\\n\\nWhen using this tactic, infantry units do not move forward as a single block. Instead, groups take it in turn to advance towards the enemy, halt, and fire. While one group is firing, others are advancing or loading for another volley. Good discipline and weapons drill are also required, so that the stationary companies will always be ready to give fire when needed. The evolution requires a great deal of coordination by officers and sergeants, and faith in their fellows by the men.\\n\\nFire and advance remains in use today as a method of advance known as “bounding overwatch”, a particularly useful technique for armoured units where tanks give each other covering fire. The first unit moves into a predetermined position and becomes the “overwatching unit”; these tend to be in cover to provide the stationary unit with protection as it covers the bounding unit. In addition, armoured vehicles being able to fire on the move with gyro-stabilised weapons has made “fire and advance” mean exactly that.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_Light_Dragoons	\\n\\nDragoon’s horses are primarily for mobility, but they are also fast and can deliver a reasonably effective charge. These characteristics make light dragoons effective against skirmishers and artillery: they can close quickly enough to not suffer too many casualties. When mounted, they are effective with their curved sabres, but to use their carbines they must dismount first. On foot, they are vulnerable to enemies in melee.\\n\\nHistorically, light dragoons often performed as a kind of police force, and were useful in suppressing riotous and rebellious civilians. Their horses give them strategic mobility, allowing them to control large areas and quickly come to the aid of the local, civil authorities. As the 18th Century drew to a close, they had lost their role as mounted infantry and most became another kind of light cavalry, although they retained the dragoon name. The officers and men welcomed the change, as “proper” cavalrymen had glamour for the ladies, a higher social status, and better pay rates!	false

Chosen for their imposing height, good conduct and loyalty, these men have excellent morale and a positive effect on the morale of nearby friendly units. Their discipline is exemplary; their reload times and the accuracy of their musketry are the envy of many. They do have some weaknesses: their extensive training and experience makes them more expensive than most foot troops, and they perform poorly against artillery and skirmishers that stay beyond their musket fire.\\n\\nHistorically, the Seamen of the Guard were formed as a result of a decree by Napoleon. They were originally intended for action as part of the planned invasion of Britain, but when these plans were put aside they took a place in the Imperial Guard. In a few short years these men had developed a wide variety of skills that made them indispensible to the Emperor. He commented that “When occasion required they proved equally valuable whether as sailors, soldiers, artillerymen or engineers; there was no duty they could not undertake.”	false

They can reload at speed, charge home with the bayonet and give a very good account of themselves in melee. Their competence and evident morale can inspire nearby troops to fight all the harder. However, like ordinary mortals in line regiments, the Guards will die under artillery bombardment, or if skirmishers start picking them off.\\n\\nThe Guards regiments are the oldest units in the British army but, in a typically British and contradictory way, they were raised by different sides in the Civil War! The Coldstream Guards were raised in 1650 part of the republican Commonwealth’s New Model Army. The 1st Foot Guards were raised in exile to be Charles II’s bodyguard. The 1st Foot Guards became “Grenadier Guards” after Waterloo in 1815 because they had beaten the French Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard. In fact, they’d driven off another unit, but the honour and name stuck. As the older regiment, the Coldstreamers have the motto “Nulli Secundus” or “second to none”, but the old republicans are still second in the precedence lists after the royalist Grenadier Guards!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCannon1_cannon_foundry_european	\\n\\nA cannon foundry allows artillery units to be recruited. Cannon production has improved greatly since 1700, as the invention of machine tools and better methods of casting have made producing cannons a much safer occupation. The changes also mean that the guns themselves are far more reliable. Their range and accuracy are vastly better than early 18th century pieces, which were usually made using the same technique as bell founding.\\n\\nBefore the 19th century advances in cannon production making guns, like any casting work, was a dangerous business. If the sand moulds were even slightly damp then a steam explosion could occur. Anyone nearby was likely to be killed or maimed by hot or molten metal and pieces of the mould.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_engineer_school_european	\\n\\nThe school teaches all the specialised skills that an officer of engineers will require, such as surveying, the use of explosives, military architecture, construction, the arts of siege warfare, military illustration (used to create maps) and much else besides. Some mundane tactical skills are taught as well, but engineers are not expected to command armies and issue orders to gentlemen. It is their lot to position guns and advise when a breach in a fortress’ walls is “practicable”, and could fall to an assault.\\n\\nSappers and miners, like artillery experts, had long history of being permanent retainers in royal armies of the medieval and Renaissance periods; siege works needed experts to demolish castle walls. Thanks to the likes of the French Marshal Vauban (1633-1707) and his magnificent fortifications, the need for military engineers to create, or break into, defences grew, not lessened, during the 18th Century. The elaborate and layered defences that he and his successors developed required skilled architects and builders. Engineer officers became a corps of highly educated experts, while leaving the hard, mucky work of digging to the rank-and-file sappers and pioneers, of course!	false

They are also famous for their meticulously correct uniforms: the post of foot guard can only be held by the very best soldiers. If necessary the guards must be willing to lay down their lives to protect the royal family. This requires a rare breed of man: highly disciplined with excellent morale, able to stand steadfast to the last. On the battlefield the foot guards set an example to inspire nearby units.\\n\\nHistorically, monarchies vied with each other to have the finest household guards in their palaces. The French Maison du Roi regiment were hand picked by the king from candidates sent in from every line regiment. Officers who sent along duffers for the duty were punished. In Prussia the “Potsdam Giants” were a quirk of Frederick I’s obsession with very, very tall men and military pomp. Oddly, Frederick was not a very warlike chap at all. He just liked tall men.	false

They are experienced soldiers and that makes them valuable on the battlefield. Formed into a line, they can deliver a volley of fire into an enemy, follow it with a decisive charge and then finish the foe in close combat. Brave or not, they are still vulnerable to artillery and sniping by skirmishers. Like other line infantry, they can form square to repulse enemy cavalry.\\n\\nThe 18th Regiment were at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, at that time the largest battle to have taken place on European soil. It was also a decisive victory for the forces of the Sixth Coalition, and Napoleon was forced to retreat. This persuaded the smaller German states to join the Coalition. Thanks to Leipzig, the Coalition forces outnumbered the French; apart from anything else, Napoleon had lost his Grande Armée during his failed Russian campaign in 1812. The Coalition further weakened Napoleon’s forces by avoiding battle with the emperor, instead attacking his less able sub-ordinates.	false

Arab poetry can be a great many styles, some of which need careful handling if they are not to offend religious sensibilities. Poetry can distract from proper Islamic studies, as well as praise God. A school of poetry teaches all of these nuances, and provides a grounding for those who wish to become court poets, a rewarding position for those who have talent.\\n\\nFinding a patron is, of course, a matter for the individual students, and a good grasp of calligraphic styles can help too.

building_description_texts_long_description_rIron1_iron_mine_european	\\n\\nLit only by candles or lamps, most miners work in hellish conditions. In some mines firedamp, or methane, produces a constant risk of explosion thanks to the naked lights. The risk of a slow death is there too: stone dust and poisonous minerals such as arsenic ruin a man as surely as any blast.\\n\\n Historically, mining accidents were very common. Miners were paid only for the valuable minerals that they extracted, so there was little incentive to carry out safety work. Pit props will prevent a roof from collapsing, but putting them in did not earn any payment. Indeed, mine owners were known to charge for the wood needed to make them. It was not just men who laboured below the ground. Women often pulled carts from the work face to the surface. Children needed less space and air than adults, which made them ideal support workers, clearing tunnels and taking food and water to the miners.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Art_Foot_7_lber_Howitzer	\\n\\nHowitzers fall somewhere between guns and mortars, the other main artillery types. Like guns, they have limited mobility and are slow moving, but are they not as accurate as cannons. They do not fire straight at the target, but lob shots high into the air to plunge down on a target. The charge of powder and the barrel angle can be varied, which means a howitzer can send an almost-vertical shot over a wall. Given such an ability, they are best employed to bombard areas where enemies are concentrated. In close action, they can fire canister rounds directly into enemy formations, blasting them with hundreds of musket balls.\\n\\nHistorically, howitzers were not easy to use. Ballistics was not a perfectly understood science and, apart from inaccurate targeting, a shell did not necessarily do any damage when it arrived. Erratic winds could send shells flying off course. Shell fuses had to be lit while still in the barrel, and the length of fuse judged to match the flight time. If the fuse was too short, the shell could explode in mid air; too long and the enemy might be able to put it out before the shell exploded!	false

technologies_long_description_economy1_land_drainage	\\n\\nLand drainage can provide new land that can be cultivated, and protect existing farmland from flooding. Marshy landscapes can be tamed, and rivers diverted to make way for productive and profitable farmland. This land reclamation and improvement gives a higher output from all farms, and provides more food.\\n\\nHistorically, the Dutch were experts on drainage using windmills to distribute water into high channels where it could flow away; this is hardly surprising given their country’s low-lying landscape. Of course, drainage was at the mercy of the wind, and developments in steam power in the late eighteenth century led to the technology being applied to drainage. The steam engine would pump as long as it had water and fuel. Indeed, stationary steam engines were first used to pump water out of mines in Britain, allowing miners to excavate deeper than before, but the principles of raising water were exactly the same for a land drainage scheme.	false

Auxiliary units may be full of experienced soldiers but they need to learn how to fight together, and to learn enough so that they can co-ordinate their tactical actions with allied forces. In battle, trust in your comrades to hold the line is a powerful thing.\\n\\nThe Spanish army did not have a great reputation as a fighting force, as it lacked discipline, tactical savvy, and even a sense of urgency. Its officers must carry a great deal of the blame, as many were nobles and gentlemen with little taste for hard, or indeed any, work. They were products of their social background, but to counter these unfortunate habits, the Cortes established academies and took officers from all classes. While this was a worthy effort, it was a little late. The country had been ravaged by war, the Cortes had little authority and less money and large scale reform was almost impossible.	false

He actually became Napoleon’s friend during negotiations over Bonaparte’s marriage to Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria. Napoleon respected him enough to give him command of the Austrian corps attached to the Grand Armée in 1812.

The layout of the gardens is intended to reflect the layout of paradise, and perfect blooms are a part of that, bringing peace, tranquillity and happiness to all citizens, regardless of social class.\\n\\nDespite the insane financial speculation of “tulip mania” in Holland during the 17th Century, the tulip was not a native plant; it had arrived from the Ottoman Empire. The Dutch, however, were quite innovative when they indulged in the lunacy of tulip speculation, trading individual bulbs at ridiculously inflated prices. They even operated a “tulip futures” market on bulbs! Dishonesty was rife and eventually the tulip market collapsed, like all financial bubbles, leaving many shocked and penniless. The Ottomans, altogether more sensible folk, simply enjoyed the tulip for its beauty, which they regarded as a gift from Allah, the Merciful.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_French_Cuirassiers_Ney	\\n\\nThese big men mounted on big horses are led by General Michel Ney, and their primary task is to crash into enemy forces and engage in hand-to-hand combat. To this end, they wear “cuirass”; back and breast armoured plates over leather padding, along with reinforced metal helmets. They carry heavy straight swords. A wise commander with a cuirassier force uses it as a battering ram to hit the enemy at a critical point.\\n\\nIn 1799, ex-civil servant Michel Ney began his career as a hussar and by 1799 his talents had already made him a general de division. He was soon taken under Napoleon’s wing and given control of the VI Corps of the Grande Armée. He continued to serve with distinction, finally earning recognition for his bravery during Napoleon’s campaign against Russia. Whilst leading the III Corps, he and his troops were overcome by the enemy and deemed lost, but Ney managed to cut his way through the Russian lines and returned to Napoleon, who dubbed him “the bravest of the brave”. His foolish charge at Waterloo in 1815, however brave, ruined the French cavalry for the remainder of the battle.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Brunswick_Line_Infantry	\\n\\nThey are an extremely versatile force, and can be relied on to give a good account of themselves in most circumstances. Cavalry will have an extremely hard time breaking any Brunswick square. However, like other line infantry they cannot be left exposed to punishing cannon fire: their bravery and skills are of little use against an artillery bombardment. Like other musket-armed infantry they are vulnerable to skirmishers if their attackers keep under cover and at long range.\\n\\nBrunswick Infantry fought alongside British troops in the Peninsular War (1810-14). They were organised, armed and equipped in a largely British fashion, as might have been expected: the men came from the “Black Band”, a Brunswicker force that had been evacuated from Germany by the Royal Navy just ahead of an advancing French army. Once reformed and retrained, and then despatched to Spain, the Brunswickers proved their worth time and again as troops who could be relied on to fight, and fight hard. They kept this reputation, and were in the Anglo-Allied army at Waterloo (18 June 1815), gallantly defending the farmhouse of La Haye Sainte against repeated French attacks.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Ottoman_Silahtar_Guard	\\n\\nFor the Ottomans, military service is not a burden, but an honour and one that men should readily embrace. The greatest honour is reserved for the Silahtar Guard, who are charged with protecting the sultan himself. If needed these troops will lay down their lives for him; such sacrifice demands an iron resolve, and the Silahtar are not easily shaken in battle. They are armed with lances, excellent for breaking through enemy lines with a devastating charge.\\n\\nBy the end of the 18th century the Ottoman Empire, despite still having an effective military, was not the power it had been. The Ottoman army was under-funded, and many men left the military to find other work. This was especially true of the cavalry. Many of the old feudal Sipahis had disappeared, and even the Silahtar Guard was largely diminished. Recognising the need for modernisation, Sultan Selim III (1789-1807) attempted to reform the Ottoman military along European lines. Unfortunately, the janissaries violently resisted his reforms, resulting in Selim’s murder.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-324484024	Your first priorities as an island nation should be to ensure you have adequate naval defences in place, as a strong navy is the key to protecting your shores. Beyond that, maintain friendly relations with other Protestant nations such as the United Provinces, Hannover, Prussia and Sweden, as the ever-present threats from Catholic France and Spain may require a joint action by allies in the near future. In addition to securing your position at home, look to the preservation of your colonies in America and the Caribbean. France and Spain are always interested in expanding their overseas territories, and your colonists will provide easy pickings for less scrupulous nations - if left unprotected. There is also much unexploited territory in the Indian subcontinent - gain a foothold here before your rivals do. The once-mighty Mughal Empire is on the verge of falling apart, but it is still important to move swiftly. The up-and-coming Maratha Confederacy is ready to pounce and forge an empire of their own, so allying with them against the Mughals could be a useful strategy. It is especially vital to act in India before the French gain a foothold and begin to work against you as they have in America.	false

technologies_long_description_economy3_steam_ship_propulsion	\\n\\nEngineering improvements to the steam engine have made it more efficient, and it is now suitable for use in ships. The only question is where to store the mountain of coal required to fuel the engine, a problem that limits the cruising range of ships and still requires them to have masts and sails. When the wind is right, it is more sensible to use it than burn coal.\\n\\nHistorically, the transition from wind-power to steam-powered vessels was slow and protracted. Apart from the need for a network of coaling ports, development of steam ship propulsion itself went through many increments and was beset by engine failures, sinking ships, bureaucracy, and false starts. Jouffroy d’Abbans (1751-1832) was one of many inventors who were almost official geniuses: in 1783, his paddle steamer, the Pyroscaphe, managed to sail for fifteen minutes down the Saône, but the French Academy of Sciences refused to acknowledge his achievement for political reasons. D’Abbans died unrecognised, bitter and impoverished.	false

start_pos_factions_description_-682525681	Russia is a giant, if it can be mobilised to face the deadly danger to peace that is Napoleon Bonaparte.\\n\\nIt is also a nation that is recovering from the assassination of the reforming Tsar Paul in 1801, a man who was too interested in reform to be left on the throne. Rumour has it that Tsar Alexander was complicit, at the very least, in his father’s death. Paul had taken Russia to war against revolutionary France. Now Alexander is beginning to realise that a French, or rather, Napoleonic hunger for victories will drag Russia into war once again. If Russia is to be seen as a major power in Europe, she must behave as a major power, or accept French domination of Europe.\\n\\nThis is why Russia now contemplates war against France again. There may be incidental gains to be made in Poland and Prussian-dominated Germany, but the threat of the new French Empire is real. Napoleon has set himself up as the equal of the Tsar, and that is an implicit challenge. There are potential allies and some, like the English, have very large treasuries.\\n\\n Russian soldiers may be rough and ready, but her generals are cunning commanders. Russia also has the advantage of time and space, should a war go badly. No invader from the west can comprehend the emptiness of the steppes, deal with the vast distances of Russia, or survive the merciless campaigns of “General Winter”.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_665527234	Your first priority should be to keep the fragile commonwealth together. There are many threats to its security from all sides: Prussia has imperial ambitions and desires to connect its fractured territory; Sweden and Russia are squaring up for war; while the Austrian Empire already controls much of the region and may expand eastward. It is unlikely that the territories of Poland-Lithuania will survive entirely unscathed, and your borders must be well-defended. Polish territory is also under threat from the south - Galicia & Podolia borders the Crimea, Belarus & Volhynia borders Russia. The Ottoman Empire may renew their quest for a greater European foothold. If so, there will inevitably be clashes with both Russia and Austria - so a wiley national leader could secure a Black Sea port from the Crimea. This would give Poland a clear line of trade to the Baltic and make it considerably richer in the process. It would also be sensible to ally with larger nations that may be able to assist Poland should her immediate neighbours attack - France, Britain, and Sweden are good candidates for trade and alliance partners.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Elite_Prussian_Foot_Guards	\\n\\nThe Prussian obsession with military drill breeds incredibly disciplined troops, willing and able to follow any order. They are able to load and fire their weapons with an accuracy and speed few can match. Their discipline makes them a deadly foe, and the powerfully built men have an edge over other units in melee. However, these skills make them expensive to recruit, and they are as vulnerable as other men to artillery fire and the sniping of skirmishers.\\n\\nThe Prussian army underwent a series of important changes just before and during the Napoleonic era. Gone were the mercenary armies of the past, replaced by a true national army. In 1809 it was decided that a set standard for the movement of battalions was required. The idea of simply placing battalions in line was replaced with a more modern “chequer-board” formation. This was made up of three main elements, the skirmish line, the main battle line and the reserves. The size of these elements varied considerably from battle to battle.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_British_Life_Guards	\\n\\nLife Guards are an elite court regiment where appearance is as important as fighting ability. This doesn’t diminish their skills as soldiers: their powerful charge is capable of breaking the most stoic of enemy lines and their skill in a fight is almost unrivalled. However, their pride can lead some to be a little hot headed: they lack the discipline of other cavalry units and, like all cavalry, they may prove ineffective against infantry in square.\\n\\nHistorically, perhaps the oddest sounding of the various royal guard cavalry regiments were the curiously named “horse grenadier guards”. Common sense would seem to indicate that these men would only ever get to throw their grenades once, before their horses took off at speed towards all points of the compass! In British service, the Household Cavalry regiments, including the horse grenadiers did not, and do not, have sergeants: they have “corporals of horse”. The word “sergeant” has the same origins as “servant”, and no gentleman, even a private trooper, is ever a servant.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCulture2_opera_house_middle_east	\\n\\nThe styles and hidden allegorical meanings of poems take much time to master, and there is a rich set of traditions to draw on from all three languages. A school of poetry teaches all of the subtle nuances of poetry, and provides a good basis for those who wish to become court poets throughout the Empire, a rewarding position for those who have talent. The presence of these talented artists, capable of spinning tales to distract and amaze brings inner peace and happiness to all classes and improves the town wealth of a region.\\n\\nHistorically, Ottoman “divan” poetry used Persian forms and many borrowed words, as Turkish did not suit the Persian rhyming schemes. Arab poetry generally could be a great many styles, some of which needed careful handling if they were to avoid offending religious sensibilities. Members of the Ottoman court were expected to be fluent in all three languages, Turkish, Persian, and Arabic, as well as having a good grasp of court etiquette and a masterful skill at calligraphy. These delicate art forms set the educated upper classes apart from the lower, who had their own spoken storytelling and poetic traditions.	false

events_event_text_lewis_clark	"Ocean in view! O! The Joy!" writes William Clark in his journal. Over two years since leaving Pittsburgh, Clark, his partner Merriweather Lewis, and the thirty-one explorers of the Corps of Discovery have finally crossed America and reached the Pacific Ocean on foot.\\n\\nAfter gaining permission for the expedition from President Jefferson, Clark purchased a large quantity of pork, salt, and medicines to feed the explorers on the journey. Along the way the party met many native tribes, and generally maintained good relations with each of them. However, once reaching the Great Plains, the expedition encountered the Sioux tribes. The Sioux were progressively less peaceful the farther west they travelled, demanding tribute in return for safe passage and giving warnings about aggression from neighbouring Sioux tribes. On more than one occasion Lewis and Clark had to escape a potentially violent situation by sailing up-river. Following the construction of Fort Mandan in early 1805, the explorers found a native guide married to a French-Canadian fur trapper – Sacagawea, who translated for the remainder of the journey. Her presence and that of her infant son also helped soften native perception of the expedition, which could otherwise be assumed hostile.\\n\\nFinally reaching the Pacific in December, the expedition camped for winter and prepared supplies for the return journey. So far there has been just one casualty – an unpreventable death from acute appendicitis – surely this expedition was meant to succeed by divine providence?	false

building_description_texts_long_description_college_european	\\n\\nA college education is expensive, and there are few charity-funded places or scholarships for the less socially fortunate. It is a privileged man who goes to college: money or patronage are needed more than intellect. Although there is discussion and teaching of the radical ideas of science and philosophy to the students, the college masters are likely to have a conservative outlook. Most of the students are the same: they are from the top rungs of society’s ladder, and they have little interest in seeing the natural “status quo” altered.\\n\\nHistorically, attending college was probably the most boring element in the education of “young gentlemen”, although the actual work required was not that arduous. The “Grand Tour” became fashionable during the 18th Century, when the rich would wander Italy (Greece being an Ottoman possession), taking in the sites of Antiquity and the great works of the Renaissance. In the process they would spend a fortune on Classic-period statuary and relics, paintings by the great masters, and anything else that took their fancy. Quite reasonably, the less aesthetically refined, but well funded, would seek an exotic “education” in local taverns and bawdyhouses!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_3_Decker_86	\\n\\nThis three-deck warship is a design compromise between wanting the firepower of a “first rate” battleship with the sea-keeping qualities of a 74-gun ship. Like many compromises, the result is not perfect, but the extra weight of fire in the broadside does compensate for poor sailing qualities. The design does have one unexpected benefit: enemy captains are often quick to identify this ship as a much larger vessel and run from a superior enemy!\\n\\nThe lower gun deck houses 32-pounders, and this explains the “tumblehome” shape: the bulge at water level and just above in the hull allows more room on the lower decks for the recoil of large cannons. Lighter guns on the higher decks did not recoil to the same extent.\\n\\nHistorically, only the British Royal Navy commissioned ships of this “second rate” class; other nations built large “first rates” instead. This was probably due to the Royal Navy’s need for large ships to act as flagships on foreign stations, an assignment that would have been wasteful and expensive for a very large ship. The second rate did retain some of the more favourable qualities of a first rate, including a robust hull. During the Battle of Cape Saint Vincent (1780) HMS Blenheim fought the Santissima Trinidad and took 105 hits to the hull, but only 13 crew members were killed and 48 wounded.	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_British_KGL_Dragoons	\\n\\nWhen mounted, these troops can either use their deadly heavy swords in close combat or break enemy line formations with a powerful charge. Their horses allow them to reposition quickly to counter enemy moves, quickly lending firepower to beleaguered comrades. However, they have to dismount before firing their carbines. They sometimes need to be kept on a tight rein by a commander, because their eagerness for battle can sometimes become recklessness.\\n\\nIn 1807, the Danes refused naval support to the British. The British, for their part, feared the Danes would support the French, and so part of the King’s German Legion marched to Denmark. On the road to Copenhagen, the 1st King’s German Light Dragoons learned that there was an arsenal in the fortress of Friederickswerk. Despite having only a single squadron to hand, Captain Krauchenberg, the dragoon’s commander, sent a message demanding the fortress’ surrender. He claimed that an army of 10,000 was on the way. His enormous fib worked, and the KGL Dragoons secured an impressive haul of enemy guns and ammunition, just as daylight revealed their actual numbers! By then, it was too late for the hapless Danes.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_2_Decker_80	\\n\\nThese large two-decker ships-of-the-line can hold more and heavier guns than most two-deck vessels. They carry 32- and 24-pounders. These powerful cannon do not have the fast reloading times of lighter pieces, but make up for that with weight of shot. It is most advantageous for a captain to hold his fire until close to the enemy, in order to do the maximum possible damage.\\n\\nHistorically, the “new pattern” 80-gun ship with two decks was considered a success. The previous three-deck 80s had been somewhat unwieldy in action. In 1758, the French 80-gun Foudroyant fought an action against HMS Monmouth (66 guns, third rate) off Cartagena in Spain. The fight lasted for over four hours, and only came to an end when HMS Swiftsure (70 guns, third rate) joined the battle. Foudroyant was captured. Once brought back to England, Foudroyant was refitted and repaired. In a further upset for the French, in 1782 HMS Foudroyant captured another French ship, the Pégase, earning her then-captain, John Jervis, a knighthood for the feat.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Guerrilla_Leader	\\n\\nGuerrilla Leaders are men of the people, driven to take up arms out by patriotism or a need for vengeance. Natural leaders and tacticians, they have proved their suitability for command by surviving and winning. They may be drawn from the minor gentry, the aristocracy, or even the common people, but are all equally capable of killing Frenchmen. They can also inspire loyalty in their countrymen. They are accompanied by a bodyguard of carbine-armed fighters, but are more effective when inspiring the men rather than risking their own lives.\\n\\nOne of the most famous, and successful, Spanish Guerrilla Leaders was Francisco Espoz y Mina, or “Mina the Elder” (1781-1836). Like many of the guerrillas he came from humble beginnings, but after seeing the behaviour of the French became determined to pay back their cruelty a thousand-fold. His determination made him feared by the French and a hero in the eyes of the Spanish, who nicknamed him “King of Navarre”. His success was, however, built on ruthlessness: in one case, he blinded and mutilated French prisoners before executing them, as a lesson to their general.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tFactory2_factory_european	\\n\\nMachines are the wonder of the modern age, allowing tasks previously limited to skilled craftsmen to be handled by the average working man. Productivity and profits are increased ten-fold, adding to the industrial wealth of a region. This does little to please the lower classes, who have awful working conditions foisted upon them.\\n\\nOne of the first factories in Britain, in the modern sense of the word, was Richard Arkwright’s Cromford Mill in Derbyshire in northern England. Unlike mills of the past, it was purpose-built to house machinery designed by Arkwright himself. The factory’s design was so successful that similar mills were established all along the Derwent Valley in Derbyshire. Towns quickly sprang up around these mills and the houses were purposely arranged to make the mill the centre of town. The need to find overseas markets for factory-made goods was one of the driving forces of British expansionism and aggressive trading.	false

campaigns_description_eur_napoleon	Behind all the Imperial façade and republican sentiments, France is once again an absolute monarchy, now ruled by Emperor Napoleon I. His efforts to secure good marriages for his brothers and marshals are dynastic politics that Bourbon kings would have grasped instantly. Yet, for all this, the French people have freedom, as Napoleon has used credit gained by his victories to remake France. Merit, as well as birth, now counts for something.\\n\\nThe Emperor’s efforts have given France an impressive empire and domination over many neighbours; he is a source of strength. Napoleon has redrawn the map of Europe to suit his own ends. He is also a great weakness, as his treatment of enemies and rivals has not been entirely politic or polite. He has caused offence to nearly everyone, taking not giving, even when he should have been conciliatory. He has managed, through poor diplomacy, to make the British look like attractive allies to many.\\n\\nAs a result, the Austrians are waiting for an opportunity to strike back at France for their recent humiliations and losses. The Russians, too, will strike down this new upstart emperor if given a chance, and will they ignore Napoleon’s instructions to ban trade with England? The Prussians, apparently, are content to sit and wait, but for how long? Will they idly sit by if it becomes necessary to extend French power in northern Germany? And then there are the British: always there are the British. That vindictive little island will have to be dealt with at some time.\\n\\nFrance, therefore, faces many rivals. But if they can be isolated and removed one by one, then Europe really will know peace, under Bonaparte, the heir to Caesar!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_Prussian_Luetzows_Freicorps	\\n\\nThe men of Luetzow’s Freikorps have immense pride in their regiment and as a consequence exhibit excellent morale. These fast, light cavalry are an effective fighting force whether charging home or fighting in close quarters. Their flexibility in battle makes them ideal for use against artillery and skirmishers, but will be of little utility against heavier cavalry in melee. As with any cavalry unit their biggest threat is infantry in square formation.\\n\\nA certain amount of romance is attached to Luetzow’s Freikorps. Following a crushing defeat on 17th July 1813, the Freikorps began recruiting in earnest; during this time a large number of intellectuals, artists and poets were drawn to Luetzow’s regiment. This was thanks in part to his reputation for personal bravery and the regiment’s reputation for derring-do. This reputation that was upheld by one of the Corps most famous members, Eleonore Prochaska: she disguised herself as a man and fought alongside her fellow soldiers until she finally met her end at the Battle of Goehrde. It was only as Prochaska lay wounded, still beating time on a stolen French drum, that she admitted her deception to her lieutenant. She was removed from the field and lived for three weeks before succumbing to her wounds.	false

technologies_long_description_military1_improved_coppering	\\n\\nBy fastening thin copper sheets over the timbers below the waterline, weeds and worms are kept at bay. The ship lasts longer because its bottom is not eaten away, and is faster by not being fouled. Upkeep costs are reduced, and handling improved. Coppering is not cheap, though, as it requires substantial work in the shipyard during construction.\\n\\nHistorically, coppering ships was not immediately accepted by the Royal Navy. The Admiralty were put off by the high cost of the copper; a second problem was that coppering actually seemed to make the rotting of ships’ hulls worse, not better. This was the result of an unexpected reaction between seawater, the copper sheets and the iron bolts used to hold them in place. These became, in effect, a large battery, and the iron bolts were eaten away by the chemical reaction, resulting in the hull falling to bits. Once iron was no longer used, “copper bottomed” became a mark of approval: something so (financially) sound it could not possibly fail. Coppering remained in use until the development of modern anti-fouling paints.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Cuirassiers	\\n\\nEquipped with heavy, straight swords and wearing armour, cuirassiers are melee cavalry. If the cuirassiers can get in among their foes, then they can do bloody work and have some protection in the fight granted by their cuirasses and heavy helmets. They are rightly feared by enemy infantry, and other cavalry forces are foolish not to treat them with a degree of respect. The price paid for this imposing strength is in speed: cuirassiers are far from swift, dashing cavalrymen. They are heavyweights, and killers.\\n\\nIn many ways, Cuirassiers hark back to an older style of warfare: cavalrymen had always been armoured, until the widespread use of firearms meant that armour was more trouble than it was worth. The magnificence of their appearance, however, added to their worth on the battlefield. Their “Minerva” style helmets merely added to the impression that here was a unit of giants. The effect was intended to be quite intimidating, and it worked: cuirassiers were always big men on big horses, heavily armoured and well trained to use shock against any weak enemy. The French army eventually abandoned the cuirass as an item of field equipment in 1915.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Trade_Ship_Dhow	\\n\\nAlthough an ancient design, the dhow is an efficient craft and can be run very cheaply, allowing profit from trade to pour into the owner’s purse! Trade can be treacherous business on the high seas, and for this reason the dhow is armed with a small number of guns so the crew can protect themselves from pirates. However, the dhow is not a warship in any way; the crew are interested in survival, not glory. A trade dhow will never be a match for any warship.\\n\\nHistorically, Europeans tended to use the term “dhow” indiscriminately to mean any vessel rigged with lateen sails, although a Middle Eastern sailor would see such a generalisation as very crude and simplistic. Lateen sails were triangular and set at an angle to the ships mast, which made them manoeuvrable but somewhat difficult in stormy conditions. The dhow was used throughout the Arab world for trade and piracy, honest men and thieves favouring the craft for its good handling and relatively high speed.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_stockade_european	\\n\\nThe walls are logs driven vertically into the ground and sharpened at the top to make a crude, thick fence. When defended properly this is enough to keep out most attackers.\\n\\nThis is the reason why a firing step for troops is usually constructed inside using either banked turf or earth rammed up against the logs. This banking has the additional benefit of giving some resilience against light artillery fire. A stockade cannot be expected to stand up to a serious pounding by cannons.\\n\\nHistorically, they were common on the American frontier where they were used as patrolling bases for contingents of light troops and local levies. Often in North America a crude stockade and the European flag fluttering above it were the only indication that you had arrived in “civilized” territory.	false

His importance to army morale cannot be underestimated, and it is foolhardy to risk him in direct combat. He should be kept well out of range of the enemy and his sword, if it is ever drawn, should only be raised with a rallying cry to bring men back to the cause.\\n\\nAs a young man, Arthur Wellesley (1769-1852) showed little of the promise and drive that would later earn him honours from numerous European nations and make him one of the most famous British generals of all time. During his early twenties, his mother worried about Arthur’s prospects until he left to study horsemanship in France. Upon his return, he displayed a new focus, bought a commission and took to politics. However, it wasn’t until he was denied permission to marry the woman he loved, and took himself to India, that he resolved to completely dedicate himself to a career in the military. His meteoric rise may have been helped, a little, by his brother who was the Governor General of British India at the time.	false

campaigns_description_mp_ita_napoleon	The new, revolutionary Republic of France is under threat from all the old reactionary nations of Europe! It is clear that there are no options other than war, and that the utter ruination of France is the only aim of Austria and France’s other enemies. The Austrians are motivated by fear: they fear their own people will follow the same revolutionary path.\\n\\nThe Austrians can be confronted in Germany and northern Italy. Austria’s possessions in Italy are ready for liberation! The other states of Italy bear watching, but should not be able to stand against the righteous anger of the French people!\\n\\nGeneral “Napoleone Buonaparte”, in charge of the Army of Italy’s artillery, has been appointed to command the entire army. It is his duty to hold onto France’s territory in the Italian peninsular. This is, however, an ambitious and skilful man and he has plans to drive the Austrians out of Italy and back to the gates of Vienna.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_gunnery_school_european	\\n\\nGunners see themselves as a “race apart” from army officers, and with good reason. They are skilled specialists who have spent years studying their trade. In the wrong hands, cannons can be as dangerous to their users as to the enemy, so gunners are actually expected to know what they are about. Unlike army officers, who have often obtained their rank through the purchase of a commission, gunners are promoted on seniority and merit. It is not enough to stand around looking brave; a gunner needs to understand military surveying and drawing, mathematics, ballistics, some military engineering, and have a grasp of technical matters. This can create tensions between “gentlemen” officers and the gunners practicing “a trade”.\\n\\nHistorically, many corps of artillery and gunnery schools are older than national standing armies, as they can date their foundations back to the times when a Master of Ordnance or Artillery was part of a royal household. The most famous artillery student is, of course, Napoleon Bonaparte; his interest was considered surprising given his background as a member of the minor nobility.	false

When formed in a disciplined line, they can unleash a massed volley of fire and then move forwards to engage in melee with the enemy. Their strength in close formation is also one of their weaknesses: they are a large target for artillery or skirmishers. Cavalry charges on the line can be devastating, but the 47th Regiment can form square when required.\\n\\nIn 1809, the Czech 47th Regiment distinguished itself at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the first battle Napoleon had personally lost in ten years. Using tactics and tricks such as laying down to minimise casualties from artillery bombardments, the Austrians prevented the French from crossing the Danube. The French would later succeed in crossing on their second attempt at Wagram a few months later.\\n\\nThe Austrian army consisted of troops from many nations, as the Austrian “empire” was a patchwork of personal fiefs and states. Many Austrian soldiers were technically from the Holy Roman Empire: ruled by Francis II (1768-1835), the Empire included 3 million Czechs until 1806. After that date, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved and Francis became Francis I of Austria. He did manage to hang on to some of the old Empire’s soldiery.	false

technologies_long_description_military4_general_staff	\\n\\nWithout paperwork, clerks and administrators, armies cannot function. Field commanders also need assistance in drafting orders, collating intelligence of the enemy and in making sure that men are properly supplied and fed. A general staff is made up of relatively junior, but trusted officers who can act as the eyes and ears of their general and, when occasion calls for it, make sure his orders are delivered in a clear and prompt fashion. With a general staff to deal with administration, a force can move with more despatch and not waste valuable time.\\n\\nHistorically, Napoleon Bonaparte made full use of various generals, favourite officers, confidential secretaries and the like to assist him. Louis Alexandre Berthier (1753-1815) was Napoleon’s Chief of Staff, and highly favoured by the emperor because of his diligence in making sure orders were obeyed. After Napoleon’s abdication in 1814, Berthier made his peace with the new King Louis XVIII. He then refused to join Napoleon on his return to Paris in 1815, and Napoleon saw Berthier’s absence as one of the reasons for his defeat at Waterloo.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Mob_Armed_Citizenry	\\n\\nArmed citizenry are a mob, given whatever guns are to hand, with brief training that the muzzle end is to be pointed towards the foe. Weapons do not make soldiers, and arming the people is an act of desperation. On the battlefield, the citizenry are unlikely to do much to damage an enemy, but the size of the mob can at least cause the foe problems. This can give real soldiers enough time to win the battle, or make the enemy pay heavily for their victory.\\n\\nHistorically, arming the people was something that really scared the authorities in every nation, particularly if the population hated the existing regime. It was not wise to supply an angry population with weapons, when these might be turned on the rulers, rather than foreigners. When Austria decided to create landwehr or militia forces, it was careful to exclude many regions from the decision as the loyalty of Austria’s many different ethnic groups could not always be guaranteed.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Lancer_Prussian_Towarczys	\\n\\nThe Towarczys lancers are a unique force in Prussian service: fast moving, and with high morale thanks to their self-belief. Trained to attack at the full gallop, their lances give them an advantage in the first few moments of hand-to-hand combat. This is often enough to break unprepared or disorganised enemies. Like all lancers, however, they are not good in a prolonged fight, and should withdraw and regroup rather than stay in a melee. Only a foolish commander would order them to attack prepared infantry in a square.\\n\\nOriginally, these troops had been the Bosniaks in Prussian service but, after 1800 they were recruited from Polish territory that had been recently conquered by Prussia. Despite the changes, they remained light lancers, indeed the only lancers in the Prussian army until the Uhlans were raised in 1808. The regiment adapted a traditional Polish idea of the nobility serving as cavalry officers called “towarzysz”, or companions. Originally, these men had joined the army with their followers, and their pay and privileges were entirely dependent on the size of their personal retinue. The Corps Towarczys was present at the Battle of Eylau in 1807, as part of the 3rd Division of the Prussian Corps; this small force was pretty much all that was left of the Prussian military after their crushing defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_school_european	\\n\\nEducation is not a right or even considered much of a privilege in many societies. The skills of reading (a little), hunting, and beating recalcitrant servants are the only worthwhile accomplishments of “proper gentlemen”. A smattering of religious education puts a veneer of civilization on top.\\n\\nThe emerging middle and mercantile classes value education a good deal more highly, and pay for it to be drummed into their children! A few schools, mostly the work of charities and religious bodies, exist to teach the children of the deserving poor, or give orphans some kind of start in life.\\n\\nThe British system of state education and “public schools” (which are actually non-state, private schools) owes its confusing terminology to this period. Public schools were open to the public – the public who could pay – while private schools took pupils as they saw fit. British mass “state education” would have to wait for another century. State education existed in some countries, but always ran the risk of creating an imbalance between learning and obedient loyalty if it was extended much beyond those with a real stake in society.	false

The result is a highly educated man, who can act as a scholar in the wider community, but has the intellectual and practical abilities needed to hold many government positions. The graduates of a yüksekokul can be relied upon to carry out their duties with diligence.\\n\\nHistorically, the Ottoman Empire relied almost entirely upon its Muslim population for administrators at every level. Minority religions were granted legal protections and treated leniently, but it was almost unheard of for a professed Christian or Jew to reach a position of high authority. Although education was valued, the janissaries did have something of a military stranglehold on the administration of the Empire. Inherently resistant to change, the janissary administrators were a deadening force in the intellectual, political and scientific life of the Empire.	false

If they meet the same units in open conflict, these skirmishers will suffer. The Silesian Schuetzen are also at a disadvantage in close combat.\\n\\nHistorically, Schuetzen units were raised from a variety of sources to defend Silesia from the French attack of 1807. They were originally garrisoned in Liegnitz and, like many units in their early years, they lacked uniformity of armament, though mostly they were armed with infantry muskets. Eventually the men were all armed with the 1787 pattern rifle, a long gun with a calibre of about a finger’s width. Unusually for a flintlock, it had front and back sights: the back sight was graded up to 300 paces, allowing startling feats of marksmanship.	false

If nothing else, the personal contacts made will be extremely useful to a graduate, even if his academic attainments are a little lacking.\\n\\nThere is also a distinctly Turkish flavour to the education on offer, as Ottoman culture and achievements are (rightly, in the view of both teaching staff and students) celebrated and studied. There is a socially and nationally cohesive view of the world that is the legacy of an education here. This is not quite the same as a purely Islamic education on offer elsewhere.\\n\\nHistorically, the Ottoman Empire was always in need of able administrators. This was one of the reasons why it came to rely on the disciplined and educated military corps of janissaries to act as imperial functionaries. This, in turn, caused problems as the janissaries became more interested in their own perquisites than in their duties as civilian officials.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_settlement_fortifications	\\n\\nSettlement defences are seldom allowed to be truly impregnable defences. Practical matters such as cost, or the need to house a growing population, often stop city fathers from investing fully in their own defences. Instead, their defences are good enough to deter a casual attack, and good enough to hold up an enemy’s advance. Interlocking fields of fire can sweep attackers off the glacis as the defenders reap a terrible toll. It takes a disciplined approach to reduce a settlement’s fortifications to the point where a breach is “practicable” and the town can be taken.\\n\\nHistorically, town garrisons were often offered the “honours of war” and allowed to march away with their weapons, but only if they gave up without a fight. The townsfolk were likely to be spared any indignity. Once, however, the attackers had launched an assault then the town, its inhabitants and the garrison were fair game for any amount of pillaging and looting. The assault was a dangerous business, and a lawless orgy afterwards was often the soldiers’ reward.	false

technologies_long_description_military3_advanced_guerrilla_training	\\n\\nThis advanced training gives guerrilla units significant skills, making them well-prepared for battle. Guerrillas are natural fighters, but a little extra practice will get rid of some of their rough edges and make them much more effective in formal battle. A little gold and a few advisory officers and sergeants can, with the support of the Spanish people, create a relatively large force of fighters.\\n\\nHistorically, guerrillas had a romantic image of being hunters and brigands who spent long years honing their skills in the mountains of Spain. Usually, however, they were simply people who had decided to take up arms for revenge, to protect their families and neighbours, and out of a sense of patriotism. It was not unusual for guerrilla leaders, despite their savage reputations, to have come from an educated background: medical men and priests were to be found leading “brigands” from the front!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_French_Contra_Guerrillas	\\n\\nThese men have been trained as guerrillas, but for reasons of their own have taken up arms against their Spanish brothers for Bonaparte. Their hunting and tracking experience helps them to hide in all kinds of terrain, and set ambushes. They fight in a loose formation and crouch to protect themselves from enemy fire. These sharpshooters are best employed in sniping at enemies, as they will suffer heavy losses in close combat and have little chance against cavalry. They will also suffer when matched against volley-firing line infantry.\\n\\nAfter the occupation of Spain in 1808, Napoleon’s forces faced considerable hostility from Spanish guerrilla bands. Local rebellions had been expected, but the sheer ferocity of the guerrillas shook the French army and morale suffered as a result. The French needed their own guerrillas and set about recruiting fugitives and deserters, as “Contra-Guerrillas”. Only those with nothing left to lose would risk facing the loyalist guerrillas, as they would face a grisly death if captured.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_71880957	Although forced back to the edges of their Peninsula by France and the traitors who helped them, Spain is not yet out of the fight. The Supreme Central Junta and its successor the Supreme Regency authorised the forming of local bands to fight guerrilla - the “little war” - against the invaders. Guerrilla bands should be used to frustrate the plans and harass the peripheries of the French armies, as both separate actions and in co-ordination with British forces currently based in Portugal. This co-operation with heretical Great Britain is an uneasy one, as your two countries have long been enemies with opposing doctrines and are now united only in the desire to rid Europe of Napoleon’s imperialism. There is, of course, another war to be won also - a war of words, hearts and minds in the villages and towns surrounding the capital, Madrid. Bonapartist provocateurs are speaking out against Spanish sovereignty and the resistance to their rule, and the priesthood must be used to change the people’s minds and remind them what it is to be a proud and patriotic people once more. Militarily, Madrid is the centre of French power in Spain, so its liberation is an absolute priority. In the north of the country the British will be taking advantage of the coasts to land fresh troops from England and fresh supplies from its colonies, so a concentration of effort should also be made to keep the French presence in those regions as insignificant as possible.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sFortifications2_improved_settlement_fort_euro	\\n\\nThese fortifications surround a town’s approaches, protecting it from assault. The scale of the defences allows a settlement to hold out for longer when under siege. The star-shaped plan of the fort means fire should cover every part of the defence and the approaches to the fort. The attackers face an uphill struggle across the fort’s glacis, with no cover at all, with a counterscarp, or ditch, waiting for them.\\n\\nHistorically, and providing that money was no object, a star fort could become a baroque and complex maze of artillery fire and death. An assiduous military engineer could add additional ravelins, or detached triangular bastions, in front of the fort’s own walls; and hornworks and crownworks, both elaborations of the basic bastion design, to the fort as well. The only limit to the defences was a practical one of artillery and musket range: no wall could be longer than a flanking musket volley range, or blind spots in the defences might be created.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_British_15th_Hussars	\\n\\nLike other light cavalrymen, hussars have speed, “dash” and an elitist attitude towards enemies. The 15th Hussars are made up of veteran cavalrymen, deadly in close combat and at the charge. Their speed makes them ideal for chasing down skirmishers and for dealing with artillery units. They carry curved sabres and, even though their charge is powerful, they are still at a disadvantage against infantry in square and heavy cavalry units.\\n\\nThe 15th Hussars were changed from light dragoon regiments as hussar regiments became fashionable across Europe. Colonel George Augustus Elliot raised “Elliot’s Light Horse”, a regiment of light dragoons. Less than a year after being raised the regiment was already 684 men strong and was marked out for overseas service. They took part in the Battle of Emsdorf, where they earned the very first named Battle Honour ever given to a British regiment. Eventually, the regiment became the 15th Hussars.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_barracks_european	\\n\\nThey are a statement in brick and stone that the military are present to defend the state and keep order. Usually constructed around a drill square, they are a carefully segregated military world deliberately kept apart from the civilians beyond. The walls present a blank, defensible, and intimidating face to the outside world. It can be important to keep troops away from the assorted temptations of flesh and the bottle. Civilians also harbour unsuitable, unmilitary ideas of disobedience and disloyalty – there must be limits to what an army can permit its men to think!\\n\\nHistorically, in Europe the fashion for building barrack blocks seemed to mirror the fascination with the Classical World of Greece and Rome. Among its other achievements, the Roman army had standardised designs for military buildings; armies in the 18th Century began to be similarly standardised. Governments employed good architects too: Nicholas Hawksmoor, for example, built the garrison barracks at Berwick-upon-Tweed for the British government. He was almost the equal of Sir Christopher Wren in talent if not in lasting fame, and produced many fine churches to replace those lost in the Great Fire of London.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_French_Revolutionary_Infantry	\\n\\nThese infantrymen are convinced that their actions are honourable, just and virtuous in defence of the Revolution and their beloved France. They are the people’s soldiers, buoyed up by high morale and a lack of experience that means they are capable of insane feats of bravery on the battlefield. Strong in numbers, and weak in discipline, they are only a little better than an armed mob, but what a mob! They burn with a zealous conviction that they are right, and this is their weapon even more than the muskets they carry so inexpertly.\\n\\nBefore 1791, the French army echoed the old feudal system: officers gained their place through family connections and title. The ordinary soldiers were treated badly. A series of mutinies and military rebellions produced some reforms in 1791: a code of justice, a reform of finances and an opening up of the officer class to the lower social classes. But it was the Revolution and the French Guards’ part in storming the Bastille that transformed the army from a tool of repression to the army of the people. The soldiers of the Revolution, though willing, eventually had to come to terms with military discipline, and that would need Napoleon.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tGuns1_gunsmith_european	\\n\\nA gunsmith specialises in the design, building and repair of firearms. Gunsmiths are skilled craftsmen who need an expert knowledge of metallurgy and a fine eye for detail. Being able to arm soldiers is, of course, an important requirement for raising effective units. A gunsmith’s factory, however, is not a pleasant place for the lowly artisans who do most of the actual work.\\n\\nOwning a good pair of duelling pistols was a must for many gentlemen, even though duelling was largely frowned upon and even illegal in some countries. This didn’t stop some of the most influential men of the time owning pistols. Napoleon owned a set personally designed for him by the influential French engineer, Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. The most famous individual to fight a duel was probably the Duke of Wellington: in 1829 he fought a duel against the 9th Earl of Winchelsea. Both men fired into the air, as the point was to satisfy honour, not kill each other.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_pNavy2_dockyard_european	\\n\\nA ship can be floated into the dock on a high tide, then the gates shut and the basin pumped out. The ship is supported on blocks, and extra timbers are used to wedge it upright as the water is drained. Workers are then free to work on the hull as required. Careful timing takes account of the tides to minimise the amount of manual pumping needed, but this does mean that work is constrained by time and tide. Like many industrial enterprises, working conditions are harsh, and a drydock adds to the misery of the lower, working classes in the region.\\n\\nIn practice, drydocks not only aided repairs, but also construction. A ship could be laid down, and then simply floated away when complete. Ship design became limited by the size of the stone or brick basin of a dock. All this work was overseen by a master shipwright and a naval architect, who often treated even state-owned docks as their personal businesses. It was not unusual for dock officials to sub-contract their friends and cronies for work, in exchange for handsome commissions, introductory fees and simple bribery!	false

Such a man, who has the respect and adoration of his followers is a valuable asset to any state, and should be treated well. It is advisable to keep this man away from combat, for his death could prove disastrous.\\n\\nMurad Bey was the fierce Mameluke chieftain that faced the French at the famous Battle of the Pyramids. Even after their defeat at the hands of Napoleon and his troops, Murad regrouped his men and remained a threat to the French for some time. The Turkish word “Bey” literally means chieftain and was the original word used to describe Ottoman leaders; later it replaced sultan as a title. Bey was used to refer to military and administrative positions that were lower in status than the “Pashas”, who were governors of Ottoman provinces. As the 19th century began, Bey came to be used as an honorific equivalent to ‘mister’ in English.	false

technologies_long_description_military5_french_cipher_decryption	\\n\\nReading an enemy general’s orders before he does so can be incredibly useful, marking the difference between victory and defeat. As the war in the Peninsular has progressed the French have developed new and ingenious ways to disguise and encode messages. Some are transported in clothes, saddles and even riding crops, but interception is only half the problem. Each message must be deciphered. However, through the dogged application of a keen mind it is possible to unlock even complicated codes, providing commanders with valuable information.\\n\\nThe Rossignol family name was synonymous with code creation but the name of Scovell should be synonymous with code breaking. Major George Scovell was one of Wellington’s staff who successfully cracked a number of French codes. He had no background in intelligence and was a self-taught code breaker, learning his craft from “The Art of Decyphering” by David Arnold Conradus. He established himself as Wellington’s cipher expert when he cracked the Army of Portugal code in two days. He also broke enough of the Great Paris Cipher to provide Wellington with valuable information that facilitated the British victory at Vitoria.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_prussia_brandenburg_gate	\\n\\nSited on one of the original city gates of Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate stands at the end of the Unter den Linden, the original approach to the city palace of Frederick II, the King of Prussia. The monumental entrance was always intended to overawe and dwarf anyone going to the palace, making clear Prussian greatness before they had even begun their audience with the monarch.\\n\\nThe choice of a Classical style was quite deliberate, as it was intended to echo the achievements of Rome and Greece. The decoration of a Quadriga of Victory, or four-horse chariot, is also intended to evoke ancient connotations of triumph, specifically the quadriga from the Hippodrome of Constantinople. It was definitely a symbol of peace through strength, which is almost certainly one of the reasons that it was looted and taken to Paris by Napoleon in 1806 after his victory at Jena-Auerstedt. The quadriga was returned in 1814, when Napoleon went into exile on Elba, and given the Iron Cross symbol that it currently carries. Subsequently, the Brandenburg Gate managed to survive two World Wars and the Cold War in a relatively undamaged state.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_cannon_foundry_european	\\n\\nThe casting of early cannons is more of an art than a science, and few of the weapons produced are standardised pieces. This is the result of casting limitations, the quality of iron or bronze available, and the manufacturing process (cannon casting was an adaptation of bell making). Most 6-pounders would be around the right calibre, but no two were truly identical. It was enough that the cannon did not burst and kill its crew, and hurled a shot in the general direction of the enemy. \\n\\nCannon foundries are also responsible for making the ball shot used by the weapons, but not the powder. No one but a raving lunatic would make gunpowder anywhere near a foundry, with the risk of stray sparks and consequent catastrophe! That said, making guns, like any casting work, is a dangerous business: if the sand moulds are even slightly damp then a steam explosion can occur. Anyone nearby is likely to be killed or maimed by hot metal and pieces of the mould. \\n\\nIn 1716, an explosion at the English foundry in Moorfields killed and injured many people when metal was poured into a damp mould. Among those hurt were Colonel Armstrong, the Surveyor-General of Ordnance. The foundry itself was totally destroyed.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_British_Foot	\\n\\nHighly disciplined and calm in the face of the enemy, these men are well trained in line infantry tactics. They can be relied upon to perform their duties with stolid determination rather than with dash and “fire in their bellies”. Their close ranks can make them vulnerable to artillery bombardment and skirmishers, and they will be ripped apart by heavy cavalry charges if they are in line. To counter this last threat, the unit can be ordered to form square. As long as discipline holds, an infantry unit in square should be able to see off enemy cavalrymen.\\n\\nThe weapon of the British line infantryman was the famous ‘Brown Bess’; a flintlock musket used, in various guises, from 1730 to 1830. Other nations had their own standard pattern of musket. The Brown Bess used a large heavy ball that would not fit into French muskets, meaning that British ammunition captured on the battlefield was useless. It could be melted down and recast, but not immediately fired at its former owners. The British discovered that, in times of crisis, it was possible to “tap load” a musket by banging the butt on the ground. The bullet was jogged down the barrel, and could then be fired.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_dockyard_european	\\n\\nDockyards also have extensive shore facilities, such as ropewalks, forges, furnaces and, possibly most important of all, seasoning sheds. Using “green” timber for shipbuilding results in vessels that can “work” (have a little flexibility), something that French shipbuilders regard as a good thing, even though it means that their ships leak in heavy seas. Seasoning wood for months or years is prudent, and most other navies follow this practice.\\n\\nOn more than one occasion in the century Royal Navy raiding parties made a point of destroying stocks of timber – in particular masts – stored in enemy dockyards. The loss of timber stocks not only set back shipbuilding by many years, but also ensured that battle damage was hard to make good too. Burning timber rather than stealing it must have gone against the natural inclinations of many RN officers and seamen, as their prize money for the goods was also going up in smoke!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rIron3_industrial_iron_mining_complex_european	\\n\\nMining is only part of the process of extracting wealth from the ground. On the surface the ore must be processed and smelted. Because iron production is easier, a mining complex also makes the recruitment of all land units a good deal cheaper.\\n\\nFor a mine owner to make as much money as possible from his investment, the ore has to have every scrap of usable metal taken out of it. This meant that a large number of processes had to be carried out on an industrial scale: the ore had to be washed, sorted by hand to extract worthless spoil, then crushed, and finally smelted and ingots cast. All of these tasks required a large number of workers, and women and children did some of the lighter work while their men laboured in the mine. Even away from the shafts, the work was dangerous and deaths and injuries were not uncommon. It was unhealthy work too: dust was ever-present and the fumes from smelting works were often poisonous. Pouring molten metal with little care for safety killed men in all kinds of horrible ways.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_industrial_gold_mining_complex_european	\\n\\nFor a mine owner to gain the maximum profit from his investment, as much usable material as possible must be extracted from the ore. This means that a large number of processes must be carried out on an industrial scale: the ore will need to be washed, sorted by hand to extract worthless spoil, crushed, and finally smelted and ingots cast. All of these tasks need a large number of workers, and women and children do the work while their men labour in the depths. Even away from the shafts, the work is dangerous and deaths and injuries are not uncommon. It is also unhealthy work too: dust is ever present, and the fumes from smelting works are often poisonous. \\n\\nA large mine workings poisons the land and water for miles around, and turns pleasant countryside into a wasteland of spoil heaps and toxic ponds.

Such is the grandeur of the scheme and, in General Napoleon Bonaparte, there is a commander of equal grandeur to undertake it.\\n\\nBefore this can be achieved, however, there are more immediate obstacles. Egypt is ruled by the Mamelukes, who are nominally loyal servants of the Ottoman Empire.

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Garde_du_Corp	\\n\\nThe Garde du Corp are elite cavalry, but they are also a court regiment where appearance is as important as fighting ability. As gentlemen they are hardly expected to associate with the common sort of soldier, and this attitude makes them unpopular with the rest of the army. However, regardless of the way they are perceived, only the best and toughest can enter the Corp, and many an enemy has met their maker at the end of their heavy swords or beneath the hooves of their thunderous charging steeds.\\n\\nHistorically, the Garde du Corp was the royal household cavalry, charged with the protection of the king and his household. During Napoleon’s reign as Emperor they were disbanded, although Napoleon did have an equivalent unit within his Imperial Guard. As with the Household Cavalry in Britain, household guard regiments did not, and do not, have sergeants: they have a “corporal of horse” or the equivalent. The word “sergeant” has the same origins as “servant”, and no gentleman, no matter what his rank, is ever a servant.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Ottoman_Siphai_Cavalry	\\n\\nThe Siphai are unswervingly faithful and deserving of their elite status. Mounted on the finest horses, they carry ornate lances that are deadly when used at the charge. When delivered to the flanks or rear of an enemy, such a charge often proves decisive in a fight. Their heavy lances mean the Siphai are vulnerable during prolonged melee and against well-trained line infantry.\\n\\nAs almost feudal fief-holders, Siphai were granted the income from a parcel of land in exchange for their military service, and were expected to supply a number of armed men. They enjoyed the high status common to many cavalry corps, and the disciplined Siphai saw themselves as superior to the oft-unruly janissaries. Rivalry between the two corps was a barely concealed simmering hatred at times. A contributing factor was that Siphai were all ethnic Turks, whereas the janissaries recruited as children from provincial Christian families and converted to the Islamic faith. Despite these petty matters, Siphai represented the best horsemen available to the Sublime Porte.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Elite_Russian_Lifeguard_Foot	\\n\\nPicked from the finest noble families of Russia, these guardsmen have a position of respect in the Russian army. Chosen for their size and strength, they are easily recognizable on the battlefield, inspiring other units with their presence and boundless moral strength. Their unfailing discipline means these men have excellent accuracy and their reload times are almost unrivalled. These skills do not come cheaply, and their only real vulnerabilities are when facing artillery and wily skirmishers.\\n\\nHistorically, the Lifeguards were the most ornate unit of the Tsar’s entire army. Hand-picked for looks and stature, they even had their jackets padded around the chest and shoulders to enhance their impressive physiques. Generally recruited from among the nobility, these men soon earned themselves an unfavourable reputation amongst other European nations for their conduct during a banquet held in their honour. Napoleon’s own guards were appalled to see the Russians tearing meat with their hands, draining glasses of wine in one gulp, and even vomiting to make room for further excesses!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Miss_Bedouin_Camel_Gunners	\\n\\nHorses cannot stand the smell of camels, and this gives all camel riders the advantage in melee. However, these soldiers are most effective when using their firepower to harass enemies, whittling down their numbers to the point where a charge will break them. They are also swift and very manoeuvrable, and this can be used to keep them out of trouble as well as send them to a critical point in battle. They will not, however, survive for long if they are sent against a disciplined and well-handled line infantry unit.\\n\\nHistorically, the Bedouin people talked before resorting to the feud, although they were very adept at defending themselves when needed. Life in the desert was harsh and unforgiving, and unnecessary squabbles or attempts to save face through violence did nothing for a man’s survival. The Bedouin were raiders on other folk but that was a matter of survival, and directed, as often as not, against outsiders.	false

Jägers are adept at hiding in cover as the foe approaches and they then use their superior marksmanship to bring down their targets. Using loose skirmishing formations, jägers are good at ambushes, but are at a disadvantage if they are forced into close combat, or ridden down by cavalry.\\n\\nThe Austrian Jägers, or “hunters” were extremely well trained and particularly adept at using cover and fieldcraft to gain the upper hand in a fight. They could stalk their targets, just as hunters stalk deer, using every bit of cover to hide their approach to a firing position. At the Battle of Wagram in 1809 jägers hid in a drainage ditch and lay in wait for the French, hitting them with a barrage of well-aimed shots.	false

technologies_long_description_admin1_national_debt	\\n\\nKings have always run up debts, borrowing money (sometimes at sword’s point) from subjects and great banking houses. The debt, however, was the personal responsibility of the king. The concept of national debt allows a nation to borrow to finance expansion and conquest. The nation sells bonds, and agrees to pay interest on those bonds every year. This simple idea increases the growth of national wealth and facilitates expansion by reducing upkeep costs.\\n\\nScottish economist, gambler, and rake John Law (1671-1729) made several advances in his field, the most notable being the introduction of the French national bank. He also proposed state control over national finances and trade. He manipulated the market by using money from monopoly trading companies to buy government bonds rather than investing in overseas enterprises. Eventually his schemes collapsed, and many Frenchmen were ruined. Law failed, but he gave the idea of government-backed bank notes, and the word “millionaire”, to the West.\\n\\nNational debt was extensively used by British governments to finance the wars against France and Napoleon. Despite the blockade of Napoleon’s Continental System, British trade was able to flourish and sustain the increasing mountain of debt that the war created.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sAdmin3_court_justice_european	\\n\\nAs such, this building adds significantly to the repression of the people in the region where it stands. Further, because the forces of law and order are in intimate partnership with the government’s tax gatherers, a law court gives their demands for money even more force. The tax gathered in a region also increases thanks to the court. Finally, the judges here have the power to use civil law to help the military’s authority and this means that they can aid military recruitment, if only by the simple expedient of sentencing wrongdoers to the ranks!\\n\\nSocial order is often more important than any amount of so-called liberty to the smooth running of a nation. To modern eyes, a court of justice was surprisingly parsimonious with the justice it dispensed: its purpose was to enforce laws that protected the status quo, which did not have to be the same thing as “justice”. Receiving justice depended more upon the social class of the defendant or plaintiff, and less upon clever legal argument or the law itself. Even in countries that prided themselves on “liberty”, such as Britain, the law courts were more interested in protecting the rights of property rather than the rights of common and poor men.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Skirm_British_Rifles	\\n\\nThe rifle gives them the ability to kill at astonishing ranges for a flintlock weapon. Their skills and skirmishing tactics allow them to use whatever cover is to hand to hide, stalk the enemy, and then kill them from a distance. Even their uniforms are a subdued colour to help them in their role as hunters and snipers.\\n\\nThey are, however, not invulnerable. Like all skirmishers, they can be cut down by a carefully timed cavalry charge. They will also suffer disproportionate casualties if exposed to a line unit’s firepower.\\n\\nHistorically, the Greenjackets, nicknamed for their dark green uniforms that blended into the landscape, carried an infantry rifle designed by Ezekiel Baker of London. This muzzle-loading flintlock used a small ball in a rifled barrel with superb accuracy. Loading was a slow business, and could take a minute or more to do properly so that a shot would fly true. The result, in the hands of an expert, was deadly. French officers came to dread the presence of the Rifles on a battlefield.	false

Their cuirasses, metal chest and back plates over leather padding, and decorative helmets give them some protection.  Their straight, heavy swords are man-killing weapons capable of inflicting horrible, maiming wounds on any opponent. A good commander does not use them against infantry in square, or leave them where artillery or elite infantry can shoot them down. Cuirassiers are a heavy force, and therefore among the slowest cavalry on the battlefield. \\n\\nContemporary commentators were as one in praising the quality of Austrian cavalry, both men and mounts, but not quite so sure that the cavalry were well used in battle. Of course, the Austrians were fighting Napoleon, so they were always going to suffer in any comparisons that were made. Their weaponry was also much admired and feared: their heavy broadswords were intended for butchery; the swords had none of the elegance that characterised hussar sabres. The British copied them for their own heavy cavalry forces.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tEducation1_college_spain	\\n\\nA college offers an academic education, perhaps a veneer of sophistication, to the sons of the aristocracy, the gentry, and the merchant classes. It may also, unintentionally, expose these people to the dangerous concept of thinking about the world, and that can create a wish for reform, if the world’s many injustices are considered.\\n\\nHistorically, a college education usually required substantial wealth, as there were scholarships or charitable places for the talented poor. Although science and philosophy were on the curriculum, the ideas taught were usually socially and politically conservative rather than radical. College masters were unlikely to see any reasons for upsetting the wealthy parents of their scholars, and most students saw no reason to question their entrenched privileges. Radicalism was confined to a small number of students, or came out in rebellious and extremely bad behaviour involving local taverns, bawdyhouses, and “actresses”. Rebellion could always be curbed by a dose of the pox, or a threat from father to cut off an allowance!	false

This inexperience and a fatalistic attitude towards survival mean that they have low morale even before the firing starts. They can, just, hold their own against militia units, but expecting much more of them is a little optimistic. They can be a useful way of getting the enemy to waste precious shot and gunpowder.\\n\\nThe Ottoman Empire had several different types of conscripted levies in its armies: “miri-askeris” were paid on the battlefield, for example, while the “yeri-neferats”, included every Muslim man, regardless of age, in a town under threat. The intention was to get as many people onto a battlefield as quickly as possible as a response, any kind of response, to an enemy incursion.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Light_French_6th_Legere	\\n\\nThese versatile veterans can form a disciplined line to deliver a massed volley, or switch to a loose skirmishing formation to harass and thin out enemy formations. Although their experience in battle means they fire their muskets with a good degree of accuracy, their flexibility also means they lack certain specialised qualities. They are not quite as accurate as other skirmishers nor as devastating as line infantry when firing in volleys. They also lack the ability to form square, which leaves them vulnerable to cavalry charges.\\n\\nHistorically, the 6th Regiment saw action in over forty battles during the Napoleonic War and were awarded seven battle honours for their achievements. Three of these were given for victories over the Austrians at the battles of Marengo, Ulm and Wagram. The loss at Wagram in 1809 was a particularly devastating blow for the Austrians, breaking their national morale and forcing them to sign a peace treaty that resulted in the loss of a large part of their empire.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Lancer_French_Dutch_Guard_Lancers	\\n\\nTrained to ride hard into battle with their lances down, these superb horsemen are ideal shock troops: the moment of impact is the moment of truth for their attack. They either break enemies, or should withdraw to charge again. Their steeds are fast moving and carry them to key points on the battlefield very quickly. Their morale is superb, but they are not suitably equipped for prolonged melee. A lancer is at a disadvantage in a close-in fight. Used against elite infantry in square their skills and lances will, of course, count for very little.\\n\\nOriginally formed as a hussar regiment, these men were transformed into lancers by a decree issued on the 23rd September 1810. Their first challenge was to learn how to handle the apparently unwieldy, but deadly lance. Several officers were sent to the Polish Lancers’ Chantilly barracks where they were drilled in the much-needed skills of the lance. These men then passed their new found wisdom to the rest of their regiment in Versailles. The reorganisation of the new Guard Lancers resulted in a number of uniform changes that proved extremely costly. The Minister of War had to ask Napoleon himself to provide them with more money to pay for new uniforms for the men!	false

technologies_long_description_admin3_bonapartist_propaganda	\\n\\nMastering the art of presenting the truth can be crucial to securing political power. This management of the public discourse will increase the percentage of replenishment for all French units. There is no guarantee a war will be popular and it is important to have the support of a people if victory is to be attained. Armies require a constant supply of fresh troops and will quickly dwindle without willing patriots. Control of what is reported and its presentation gives a canny leader the chance to make failure sound like heroic bravery!\\n\\nPart of Napoleon’s genius was in recognising the utility of the popular press and how to control it to suit his own purposes. Early dispatches and military newspapers from his Egyptian campaign not only kept the French army’s morale high, but also served to raise Napoleon’s public image. He was, as a result, greeted as a hero on his return home. He eventually owned several newspapers, publishing his own articles under pseudonyms and censoring anything that could be damaging. All this served his political ambitions and he became Emperor of France with the full support of the French population.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_3_Decker_106	\\n\\nWhile these warships are among the most powerful vessels afloat, they are lubberly sailors, being both slow and unresponsive. This is not a serious shortcoming because, armed with 106 cannons firing 32-, 24-, and 18-pounder balls on their three decks, they deliver a terrible and destructive broadside. They actually have more artillery than most land armies! Their cost, however, is a drawback and few navies can afford to build or maintain more than a handful of them.\\n\\nHistorically, 106-gun ships-of-the-line were never common, and hardly ever sent to overseas stations. They were pure battleships, existing only to fight in set-piece actions, and not for mundane duties such as protecting merchantmen, policing the seas and hunting down privateers. They were commissioned and richly decorated as a physical representation of the glory of the state, but this practice went into decline as warfare became more intense, forcing ships to become more functional.	false

This building adds greatly to the repression of the people and, because of the sanctions that judgements here can impose, it also makes the job of tax collection much more efficient. An errant taxpayer dragged before this court should be in fear of losing more than just his purse! The threat of law is also the sanction that is required for recruiting soldiery.\\n\\nIn addition to his military genius, Napoleon is also well known for his code of laws, the Code Civil, that established an easily understood legal framework in 1805. This was not the only law code that the Revolution produced. The Penal Code of 1791 simplified the criminal justice system too. Despite being codes of justice, the codes were not all that fair to everyone concerned: the accused in a criminal case, for example, was not necessarily allowed a defence lawyer. By not being bound by precedent, cases were argued on their apparent merits, not on whether previous legal judgements could be used to sway the judge with the power of tradition.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Stand_Spanish_Line_Cavalry	\\n\\nArmed with a traditional straight sword, as opposed to the ever-popular sabre, these cavalrymen are a multipurpose unit. They are light enough to chase down a routing enemy, but heavy enough to charge effectively into enemy lines. However, their versatility comes at the cost of specialisation: should they be pitted against the likes of horse guards, their lack of specialist training will become apparent. \\n\\nSpain and the Peninsular War proved to be a major part in the downfall of Napoleon and this was thanks, in part, to his older brother Joseph. Joseph helped his brother to take control of France during the revolution and was rewarded with the throne of Naples in 1806. His time as king was brief, and he was soon sent elsewhere when Spain fell under Napoleon’s control. Napoleon needed someone he could trust on the Spanish throne and Joseph was the obvious choice. However, French occupation of Spain was unpopular to say the least and Joseph never really managed to gain a steady grip on the country. French control was eventually broken at the Battle of Vitoria and Joseph abdicated, fleeing back to France.	false

technologies_long_description_admin3_metric_system	\\n\\nMany measuring systems are age-old, and based on some aspect of human physiognomy: hands for measuring horses and the like. There are quirky relationships within measuring systems: who would set out to design a weight scale that has 16 ounces in a pound, yet 112 pounds in a hundredweight?\\n\\nA metric system creates arbitrary, but scientifically derived, units for length, volume, area, weight, and so on. One unified system can measure everything, and there is no complicated mathematics required, as only multiples of ten are used. Adopting such a scheme increases research rates and allows further research in a number of areas.\\n\\nHistorically, the French were not the first people to attempt a codified measuring system, but the work done by the French Academy of Sciences in the 1790s was certainly the most organised approach up to that time. Although officially adopted quite quickly, the public were not required by law to use metric measures until 1840. The metric system is now the de facto standard for all national armies, although many navies still use old “imperial” units like the fathom for depth and knot for speed.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Carabiniers	\\n\\n Carabiniers are a brute force unit, used to deal the final blow that drives an enemy from the field of battle. They are excellent close combat troops. Their only weakness is against well-disciplined elite infantry who are capable of forming a square: this combination can prove deadly to this slow-moving unit. As heavy cavalry they are not expected to chase down an enemy, as this is a job better saved for light cavalry forces.\\n\\nFollowing the French Revolution, many of the royal corps in the French army were abolished and French carabiniers had every reason to expect that the same fate awaited them. In an attempt to preserve the traditions and privileges of their corps they sent Colonel Comte de Pradel to appeal to the Legislative Assembly. After a vote the new organisation of the French cavalry was decided. The carabiniers remained in service but became known as the ‘Grenadiers des troupes a cheval’ and their gold-trimmed hat was replaced with a peaked bearskin cap.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_military_academy_european	\\n\\nIn most countries, military command is limited to those in the ruling classes. There is a quite sensible belief that only those with a stake in the survival of society will defend it properly. However, there are counter-arguments to the effect that military matters are complicated, and “gentleman amateurs”, no matter how well connected, are not good enough. Military academies, therefore, teach the theory and practice of the military sciences. The graduates, however, are sometimes regarded as common tradesmen because of their knowledge.\\n\\nThe French were the pre-eminent military power of Western Europe, and lead the way in military teaching with the creation of an “École Militaire” in 1751 to educate promising cadets from poorer backgrounds. It was later re-organised and re-named as the “École des Cadets-gentilshommes” or “School of Young Gentlemen” which subverted the original intent, although Napoleon Bonaparte was a graduate of the new school. By contrast, the United Kingdom’s military schools mostly provided an education for the orphans of serving officers, with no more than the hope that the pupils would go into the army. The Ottoman military system included the Janissaries, a class of warrior-administrators, selected and indoctrinated as children, who effectively ran the Ottoman Empire.	false

The fort itself controls the surrounding countryside completely: no foe can move in southern Maharashtra without being observed.\\n\\nThe fort was taken by Shrimant Shahu Sambhaji Raje Bhonsle Chhatrapati Maharaj (1682-1749), the fourth ruler of the Maratha Empire. Shahu Chhatrapati was a survivor, of both Mughal captivity and a Maratha civil war. He was freed at the end of the War of 27 years (1681-1707) and managed to bring stability and careful expansion to the Marathas. Given that he had spent most of his childhood as an honoured prisoner of the Mughals, his efforts are creditable indeed.	false

Money, rather than sea experience, becomes the driving force for success, and trade does not even need to go through the basin to make money for the men of property!\\n\\nThe infamous triangle of trade between Bristol and Liverpool in England, Africa and the Caribbean sugar islands is possibly one of the most profitable trades ever invented. Manufactured goods, guns, cloth and trinkets went to Africa, where they were traded to the local warlords. Slaves, carried in the most horrendous conditions imaginable, made up the cargo for the middle run, across the Atlantic. In the Caribbean, the survivors were sold, and the ships loaded with sugar and rum for the run back to Britain. There was a handsome profit on each leg, and the ships were never idle. Even better, the merchants of Bristol and Liverpool never needed to see the suffering their commerce caused, always assuming that they cared.	false

As these houses accumulate greater wealth they become increasingly powerful.\\n\\nHistorically, one of the oldest merchant banks in Britain was the Barings Bank, established in 1762 by father and son Francis and John Baring. They were best known for their involvement in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. The United States of America wanted to purchase the territory of Louisiana from the French, but impending war with Britain led to a French refusal to accept the bonds that America offered as payment. During the temporary period of peace, Barings acted as an intermediary between the two countries, buying the bonds at a cut down price from Napoleon and providing him with the equivalent gold, which came to $8,831,250. Barings is better remembered today for its spectacular collapse in 1995, after speculation by one of its traders broke the bank.	false

technologies_long_description_economy3_interchangeable_parts	\\n\\nMany devices are hand-built by craftsmen to extremely high standards, but this brings its own problems. If a designed component doesn’t fit into a machine, it can be carefully worked until it does; in itself, this is no bad thing, but the altered piece may not now fit into an apparently identical mechanism.\\n\\nBy making identical parts within a fine tolerance, identical machines can be built from any mixture of those parts. Work can be divided up amongst craftsmen, and broken parts can be replaced easily, even by a user! This is particularly useful for the military, as muskets and other equipment can be quickly repaired in the field rather than being thrown away or expensively rebuilt.\\n\\nThis advance became widely known about thanks to American inventor Eli Whitney (1765-1825). He built ten muskets in front of a US Congressional committee, took them to pieces, mixed up the parts, and rebuilt the muskets. The act was impressive, but he had cheated by having all his demonstration pieces carefully handcrafted to extremely exacting standards. He was largely copying the ideas of Frenchman Honoré Blanc.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rWine2_winery_european	\\n\\nA winery takes the product of several vineyards and produces wine on a large scale, shipping much of it in casks to distant markets. A winery improves the happiness of all classes and increases town wealth in a region.\\n\\nGlass bottles are expensive, and it is better to ship wine in casks to market and then have the consignment bottled by wine merchants to suit local tastes. The casks can then be broken down for easy shipment back for refilling. The maturing process that happens in the casks is a happy accident that improves the flavour of the wine!\\n\\nThe 18th Century was a period when food adulteration was common; whitening flour with chalk was a common practice. Wine was no exception, and watering was the least offensive and probably safest practice, as alcohol would kill infectious parasites and germs in the water. Also common was the practice of sweetening wine by adding various chemicals, including lead. Lead was known to be poisonous, but without laws to protect customers, there was nothing that could be done to stop vintners and food merchants adding anything they wanted to everyone’s food and drink.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Stand_Chevauxlegers	\\n\\nThe Chevauxléger regiments may not be the strongest or fastest cavalry, but their courage cannot be faulted. What they lack in specialisation they compensate for by versatility: they can be set almost any cavalry task to do. A wise commander needs to bear in mind that they should not be pitted against heavier, more professional cavalry. Instead, they can be used to attack light infantry or as relief for beleaguered comrades.\\n\\nThe Austrian cavalry of the Napoleonic Wars were one of the most powerful forces of the period, but they were often hampered by the poor quality of regimental officers. Officially, good officers were recognised as vital to success, even more so than having good men in the rank and file. Yet favouritism, patronage and personal politics meant that command positions were often given to men with the right connections. Idiots, reckless fools and cowards could be, and were, appointed to command. If they were lucky, the men of their regiments were good enough to save them and their reputations.	false

technologies_long_description_admin3_code_napoleon	\\n\\nThe Code is a set of laws designed to protect the ideals of the Revolution, but also to protect the rights of people and property in France. Some measures are surprisingly liberal, while others give almost draconian powers to family heads over wives and children. The intention, however, is to create a legal system that everyone can understand, and one that can control the population. The Code Napoleon increases repression, but improves happiness among the lower and middle classes.\\n\\nNapoleon claimed to prize his Civil Code above all his other works. In 1800 he ordered distinguished lawyers to remake French law in just five months. Although they did not meet the deadline, the code is still the basis of French law today. The clarity of the system has appealed to many other, non-French nations since, and some 70 nations now use a similar, proscriptive system of law. The Anglophone world continues to rely largely on a common law system, where precedent is used to determine legality, for much of its everyday law.	false

The members are also in charge of powder production for the army and navy too, all too often with the bureaucratic muddle and rivalry that this can cause. The Ordnance is an important national asset because artillery is very expensive and yet a measure of national power.\\n\\nHistorically, great guns and siege weapons always required specialists to operate them, men quite separate from common soldiery. In charge was a Master of Ordnance, a man of some importance in medieval royal households. His duties of looking after the king’s artillery train eventually required a large staff of gunners, founders, powder makers, mathematicians, surveyors and even wagon drivers. In time, all of these men came under the control of the Board or Council of Ordnance, depending on the state involved, and they extended their responsibilities to take in the management of fortresses and, in some cases, the manufacture of all weapons for the army and navy.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tReligion1_chapel	\\n\\nIn a time when basic education is not a right but a bought-and-paid-for privilege, the education provided by Church schools is often very good, as well as being the only option. There is, of course, a Scriptural emphasis in what is taught, but the sons of merchants, nobles and the wealthy can gain a good grounding for life and, possibly, further education. A few gifted pupils may be offered charitable scholarships, but these are few and the recipients are never permitted to forget that they should be showing appropriate gratitude. Patronage must always be appreciated!\\n\\nHistorically, learning had been the preserve of the established Church in many countries. A priest was both tutor and confessor in many communities and households. It also made sense for the Church to control access to education, for that way heresy and dissent could be stamped out early. For non-conformist preachers, offering education to paying clients was also a way of subsidizing their meagre income and spreading the Word of the Lord in the process.	false

campaigns_description_mp_eur_napoleon	Behind all the Imperial façade and republican sentiments, France is once again an absolute monarchy, now ruled by Emperor Napoleon I. His efforts to secure good marriages for his brothers and marshals are dynastic politics that Bourbon kings would have grasped instantly. Yet, for all this, the French people have freedom, as Napoleon has used credit gained by his victories to remake France. Merit, as well as birth, now counts for something.\\n\\nThe Emperor’s efforts have given France an impressive empire and domination over many neighbours; he is a source of strength. Napoleon has redrawn the map of Europe to suit his own ends. He is also a great weakness, as his treatment of enemies and rivals has not been entirely politic or polite. He has caused offence to nearly everyone, taking not giving, even when he should have been conciliatory. He has managed, through poor diplomacy, to make the British look like attractive allies to many.\\n\\nAs a result, the Austrians are waiting for an opportunity to strike back at France for their recent humiliations and losses. The Russians, too, will strike down this new upstart emperor if given a chance, and will they ignore Napoleon’s instructions to ban trade with England? The Prussians, apparently, are content to sit and wait, but for how long? Will they idly sit by if it becomes necessary to extend French power in northern Germany? And then there are the British: always there are the British. That vindictive little island will have to be dealt with at some time.\\n\\nFrance, therefore, faces many rivals. But if they can be isolated and removed one by one, then Europe really will know peace, under Bonaparte, the heir to Caesar!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_wineries_european	\\n\\nGlass is expensive, and it is better to ship casks to market and then have the consignment bottled by wine merchants to suit local tastes. The casks can then be broken down for easy shipment back for refilling. The maturing process in the casks is a happy accident that improves the flavour of the wine!\\n\\nThe 18th Century was a period when food adulteration was common – whitening flour with chalk, for example – and wine was no exception. Watering was the least offensive and probably safest practice, as the alcohol would kill infectious parasites and germs in the water. Also common was the practice of sweetening wine by adding various chemicals, including lead. Lead was known to be poisonous, but without legislation to protect customers, there was nothing that could be done to stop vintners adding whatever they wanted to wine.	false

The 1st Hussars are, without exception, superb horsemen, and all have a certain independence of spirit that makes them ideal for chasing down widely scattered men. They carry curved sabres and, even though their charge is a powerful attack, they are weak when pitted against infantry in square and against heavy cavalry units.\\n\\nAustria had raised units of irregular Magyar horsemen called “huszárok” in the mid-15th Century, and they had fought bravely for Matthias Corvinus, Duke of Austria and the King of Hungary and Croatia, but it was not until the 1680s that regular hussar regiments were formed. Having proved their utility in Austrian service, other nations soon added hussars to their own armies and enthusiastically adopted hussar uniform as a fashion statement for cavalrymen.	false

There is more to be earned from shipping valuable goods to new markets in other countries. The ability to warehouse an incoming cargo and only release it when the price is right also increases profits.\\n\\nMost maritime nations – Britain and Holland in particular – had rules that enforced a native nationals-only rule for carrying goods into their ports. Anything, for example, that arrived in the Port of London should have come in a “British bottom”. This kind of protectionism in trade also applied to colonies and indirectly caused at least one war, the War of Jenkins’ Ear (1739-48), between Spain and Britain. The Spanish were alleged to have chopped off the ear when Jenkins was caught trading in Spanish territory; the British had previously agreed a treaty not to do this. The war became part of the War of Austrian Succession (1740-48) but, incidentally, marks the first public occasion that “God Save the King” was used as the British national anthem, to celebrate the capture of Puerto Bello in Panama by Admiral Vernon.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sArmy4_military_academy_european	\\n\\nIn most countries military command, especially in peacetime, is usually limited to the sons of the ruling and propertied classes: only those with a significant stake in the survival of a nation will defend it properly. However, the counter-argument is that military matters are complicated, and “gentleman amateurs”, even if extremely well bred, may not be good enough. Military academies take in those who have talent, and teach the theory and practice of the military art. The graduates, however, are sometimes regarded as tradesmen because of this vulgar professionalism.\\n\\nThe French were the pre-eminent military power of Western Europe, and led the way in military teaching with the creation of a “École Militaire” in 1751 to educate promising cadets from poorer backgrounds. It was later re-organised and re-named as the “École des Cadets-gentilshommes” or “School of Young Gentlemen”, which neatly subverted the original intent, although Napoleon Bonaparte was a graduate of the new school. On the other hand, the United Kingdom’s military schools mostly provided for the orphans of officers, with no more than a vague hope that the pupils would follow their fathers into the army.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_2_Decker_HMS_Elephant	\\n\\nLike all ships-of-the-line, HMS Elephant is not a handy ship, being slow and unresponsive to the helm. Good sailing qualities, however, are secondary to the weight of broadside that she can both deliver and withstand. This is important in a warship that is intended to form the centrepiece of any squadron and possibly act as an admiral’s flagship.\\n\\nBuilt on the River Hamble in Hampshire, an estuary with a centuries-old shipbuilding industry, HMS Elephant was one of a class of 12 third-rate, 74-gun warships. The class was designed by Sir Thomas Slade, possibly the best naval architect of his time, and most were built by private contractors using standardised plans. HMS Elephant was chosen by Vice-Admiral Nelson to be his squadron flagship at the Battle of Copenhagen (1801), thanks to her shallow draft, which was considered a useful feature when attacking a fleet at anchor. Another Slade-designed ship, HMS Victory, carried the promoted Viscount Nelson to his final victory and death at Trafalgar in 1805.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_shipyard_european	\\n\\nThe services of a smithy within the yard are also very useful, as most ships use a surprising amount of bespoke ironwork in their construction, not to mention hundreds of nails! A shipyard can produce smaller vessels and carry out repairs and maintenance too. Careening is a regular chore for wooden vessels: hulls become fouled with weeds and barnacles that cause drag and slow the vessel. A shipyard has all the gear necessary to empty a ship, then haul it onto a beach or slipway so that it can be scraped clean and washed by the tides.\\n\\nHistorically, shipyards needed a good source of timber close by, or were on the estuaries of navigable rivers (so that wood could be shipped from further inland to the yard). Buckler’s Hard on the Beaulieu River in the New Forest in southern England is a typical shipyard in where it was constructed. However, it is larger than many, and had an extensive staff of artisans and could handle two ships at once. The shipwrights of Buckler’s Hard built HMS Agamemnon, Admiral Horatio Nelson’s favourite ship, in 1781; many of the crew were equally attached to their captain, and followed him to later commands.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1065946002	Napoleon and his godless revolutionaries have no respect for the status quo, they insist on meddling with the balance of power on mainland Europe. Defenceless Liguria has been annexed by France, and such behaviour cannot be tolerated. As a result, Great Britain has joined forces with Austria and Russia to oppose French continental ambitions. Sweden, Portugal, and the smaller Italian states have vowed to aid the struggle, but the three great powers must take most of the strain in opposing this monstrous revolutionary threat. Whilst Austria and Russia attempt to deal with Napoleon on the fields of Bavaria, you must ensure that his navy is kept in check. Admiral Villeneuve's fleet must be intercepted by the Royal Navy, lest the armies of France march on British shores. Then ensure blockades are maintained across all French ports. Finally, your long-standing ally Portugal must be aided in pushing through into occupied Spain, opening a second front, and splitting the might of Napoleon's armies.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_roads_metalled	\\n\\nThe road is actually constructed in layers of increasingly large stones (going down through a cross-section), with each layer being compressed by rolling. The end result is a solid path that can drain cleanly. This method is often used for the key strategic and commercial routes between cities and defence points. Tolls are often charged to private users of such excellent roads and turnpikes.\\n\\nHistorically, “metalled roads” were only covered in “tarmac” after 1820, when the idea of using tar to stabilise the top layer of stones was tried by John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836), although “tarmac” itself was not called that until 1901!\\n\\nRoad building produced some other interesting characters, such as Blind Jack of Knaresborough, Yorkshire. Although completely sightless thanks to childhood smallpox, John “Jack” Metcalf (1717-1810) was, at various times, a fiddle player, an army recruiter, and a haulier. When a turnpike was built near his birthplace he used his local experience to create a masterpiece of a road, including a section on a raft of logs across a bog. His blindness was no handicap in bringing road projects in on time and to cost, although he was always at a loss to explain to others how he managed his finances so well.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_conservatorium_european	\\n\\nWhile the emphasis is on music for a cultured and upper class audience, the education provided by a conservatorium is practical and vocational. Those who pay the fees intend to earn a living as musicians, at the very least in the orchestra of a wealthy patron and, at best, as a composer of some renown, able to choose between commissions, patrons and even nations! A conservatorium has to provide what its customers want, and they generally produce well-polished musicians who can pass themselves off, when needed, as professionals or members of the minor gentry.\\n\\nHistorically, many of these schools began as either royal academies of music or choristers’ schools for the great cathedrals. All music had to be performed live, and the need for new, innovative and exciting music at every state or religious event required an enormous number of musicians – and talented composers with prodigious work rates! Great composers, such as Mozart or Handel, were celebrities and royal houses outbid each other in an effort to obtain their services as a prestigious ornament to a court.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Skirm_Norwegian_Ski_Troops	\\n\\nTheir skis are the perfect way of moving across a snowy landscape at speed, although it is often easier, and stealthier, to walk into battle. Mobility allows these soldiers to quickly select good firing positions and then make full use of their sniping skills, honed over years of hunting. Their hunting experience allows them to hide in plain sight and their loose formation provides them with a small amount of protection from enemy missile troops.\\n\\nHistorically, the rifle was an expensive item to manufacture, as the barrel required careful machining to create the grooves that impart spin to the bullet; smoothbore weapons were nowhere near as difficult to make. A rifled barrel, however, would shoot further and with more accuracy than any smoothbore.\\n\\nSki-ing as a tool of warfare has a long history in Scandinavia, being first mentioned in the 13th Century works of Saxo Grammaticus, the Danish historian and antiquary. Ski troops were able to cover vast distances at speed in wintertime, giving them strategic mobility, and yet remain fresh enough to fight a battle.	false

The building subsequently came into the possession of Duke Albert of Saxen-Teschen, the former governor of the Netherlands. He brought his extensive collection of artwork and antiquities back to Vienna from Brussels, and had the palace extended to hold them all.\\n\\nIn 1776 the collection was expanded when the Austrian ambassador in Venice, Giacomo Durazzo, gave around 1000 artworks to Duke Albert, so that they would have a safe home.

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_unitedprovinces_kweekschool	\\n\\nThe Dutch Navy owes its existence to the arming of Dutch trading ships in the 16th Century and earlier, often in direct contravention of orders from their Spanish overlords. The independently-minded Dutch were not minded to take much notice of such instructions. A centralised navy, dedicated solely to warfare, could trace its origins back to 1488, and had managed to dominate the seas for much of that time.\\n\\nA formal training system for officers, however, had to wait until 1785 when this land-based training establishment was opened. Before that, officers had learned their trade at sea, in a very practical way. The whole business was formalised under the short-live Republic of Batavia (1795-1806), although by this time maritime supremacy had passed to the British Royal Navy. Nevertheless, the Kweekschool voor de Zeevaart was one of the most prestigious naval schools, and produced fine officers.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rWine1_vineyards_european	\\n\\nA vineyard is a farm dedicated to the growing of grapes and the production of wine. Thanks to poor quality water supplies in towns and cities, wine, along with ale, is the standard drink of many Europeans, and one of life's little pleasures. Alcohol provides a welcome distraction from life's anxieties, for the lowliest revolutionary serf to the richest nobleman. Building a vineyard will result in a small improvement in happiness, while also slightly improving town wealth.\\n\\nThe patterns of growth and consumption of wine in the 18th Century often had some odd roots. The British taste for “claret" or Bordeaux wine, dates back to the Middle Ages when the English monarchy controlled the region. Napoleon’s Continental System of denying trade to English merchants also damaged the claret producing areas of France and probably helped make English drinkers very angry when they sobered up! There were many more local grape varieties under cultivation, because pests accidentally imported from America in the 19th Century wiped out older varieties. Wines would have tasted very different from each other, even within the same region than is the case today.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1766231494	Your first priority should be to defend your home region against the Catholic Spanish, who are seeking to destroy Protestantism and restore superstition and fear to the land. Following that, capturing Flanders would not only expel the Spanish from northern Europe, it would also unite all Netherlanders under a single banner. It is important to make and maintain alliances with other Protestant nations - you are already allied to Britain by virtue of William of Orange’s position on the throne of England, and the military might of Prussia could make them an important ally. You should also try to expand your colonial possessions in the Caribbean Sea. Trade is an essential part of Dutch culture, so keep sending Indiaman merchant ships to the Trade Theatres in the South Atlantic, East Indies, off the coast of Africa, and your colonies in the Caribbean and Ceylon. Maintain a navy to patrol your sea trade routes and protect them from attack.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1886952522	Your first priority should be to bolster your armies through recruitment in order to adequately patrol France's extensive borders. The Alsace region to the east could be under threat - the inhabitants are largely German-speakers, so Prussia or Austria may try to take it back in an attempt to forge a single German Empire. However, a protracted land war with either of these nations may prove unwise, despite the strength and reputation of the French army. The territories of the Holy Roman Empire to the east are good Catholic populations under the corrupt yolk of heretic Lutheran masters. As such, the territories of Rhineland and Wurttemburg are potential targets for a Catholic French army wishing to bring the true religion back to the faithful. Also look to expand your foothold in the new worlds of America and India before the British colonise both continents – therefore becoming too powerful to keep in check. There are still unexplored native territories on the American continent, although the Spanish have begun expansion in that direction - so time is of the essence. In India the landscape is changing – the old Mughal Empire is starting to collapse and lose territory to their Maratha rivals. The British, Dutch, and Portuguese are all active in this theatre, so you should make alliances and secure territory before they do. Make trade agreements in order to sell your colonial resources, open as many trade routes as possible between France and her colonies, and patrol routes against attack as much as possible. An alliance with Spain may also be fruitful, acting as a counter-balance to the current British monopoly in America.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Lancer_Prussian_Brandenburg_Uhlans	\\n\\nThe Brandenburg Uhlans are lucky enough to count some of the most experienced cavalrymen in Europe among their number. These men are excellent riders and can persuade their steeds into breathtaking acts of speed, be it to reach a surrounded friendly unit or to charge down a routing enemy unit. However, should these men find themselves in prolonged close combat they will quickly suffer heavy losses. They are best employed in short, sharp attacks that give them room to manoeuvre.\\n\\nHistorically, Major Fredirick von Schill of the Prussian army was the original commander of what would later become the Brandenburg Uhlans. It was his actions that would lead Fredrick II to rename the regiment. Schill decided that the newly-created state of Westphalia was ripe for rebellion and made the ill-advised decision to rise against Napoleon. This revolt was quickly crushed, and Schill paid a terrible price for his folly. He was decapitated, his body was dumped in an unmarked grave, and his head was sent to Jerome Bonaparte, the ruler of Westphalia, as a trophy.	false

They have kept the tradition of Turkish bravery and blended it with the drills and formal tactics practiced by European armies. This includes adopted their Western-style uniforms and bayonets. This makes them effective against enemy cavalry, but they remain vulnerable to artillery fire and the sniping of skirmishers.\\n\\nThe Nizam-I Cedit was the first westernised infantry in the Ottoman Empire. By the late 18th century the Ottoman army was struggling against modern forces. The janissaries, the Ottoman’s shock troops, had become corrupted and ineffective. This forced Selim III (1761-1808) to establish a “new model” army with help from French military advisors. Though the Nizam-I Cedit proved a success in battle, the corps was disbanded in the aftermath of the Janissary revolt that deposed Selim III.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_ordnance_factory_european	\\n\\nThe large-scale manufacturing of cannons is a monopoly often retained by the state, even in a republic: there is no need for anyone other than a government to own large cannons! The creation of large guns is also a difficult and expensive business, and the state is the only authority that can afford to do it. The number of guns available is therefore a measure of national prestige, and the ability to produce guns (rather than buy them from foreigners) is equally prestigious. An ordnance factory adds lustre and firepower to armies.\\n\\nHistorically, most ordnance factories began as royal establishments, giving the crown in each nation a source of cannons. These were needed for reducing the castles of recalcitrant barons! Even though politics moved on, the state control of cannon production remained. The royal household or near-ministerial status of the Master Gunner or Master of the Ordnance is proof that artillery was an important part of national or royal prestige. Size really did matter! The Ottoman Turks had a strong tradition of artillery production, in particular heavy siege guns.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_Bedouin_Camel_Warriors	\\n\\nLiving in a desert makes a man tough and ruthless, or dead. The weak do not survive, and this fierce life produces proud and dangerous warriors. Their battle skills have been honed by years of raiding, goat thievery and fighting against the more settled people of oasis villages. The smell of camels riding into battle terrifies horses, giving these Bedouin warriors the edge over European cavalry. However, should they meet European elite infantry their weakness becomes apparent as their cumbersome steeds make excellent targets.\\n\\nTraditionally, the name Bedouin is derived from the Arabic word ‘Bedu’ meaning ‘inhabitant of the desert.’ The Bedouin were among the most dangerous of desert tribes, fighting among themselves when outsiders weren’t available. Constantly on the move to find new pastures for their livestock, the Bedouin learned to live with the minimum of possessions and external support in the harshest of conditions. Loyalty to tribe and family was all that helped a man survive.	false

The Hungarian Grenadiers are a sight to behold on the battlefield in their magnificent uniforms. Not only are they experts in melee and impressive on the charge, but they also display extraordinary marksmanship skills. Their only real vulnerability is artillery fire and, possibly, the danger of being charged from the rear by heavy cavalry. Even under tough circumstances their courage still inspires nearby comrades and encourages them to battle on as well.\\n\\nHistorically, military enlistment in Austrian service was originally for life, but by 1757 limited service was introduced in the hopes of attracting better recruits and thereby improving the calibre of the soldiers. Men were allowed to enlist for a maximum of six years, or for the duration of any hostilities, whichever was longer. The Hungarian units in the Austrian army were raised by feudal levy. Although the Austrians had an integrated army, and shared a Hapsburg monarch with Hungary, the two nations remained separate kingdoms.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tReligion2_church	\\n\\nThe syllabus concentrates on giving students the theological, spiritual and philosophical tools needed to carry out their duties, as well as a solid “Classical” education to produce men who will be well-respected members of society. Where science and the natural world are touched upon, it is always with an emphasis on how they reveal God’s grand plan of creation. A seminary is not intended to produce an enquiring mind, only a very disciplined one.\\n\\nHistorically, the seminary system owes its existence to the forces of the Counter-Reformation, a movement that aimed to defeat the heretical, Protestant views of Martin Luther and his ilk. The Council of Trent had recognised education as a weapon in its struggles against schism. The Church required an educated and intelligent group of priests, who could argue successfully in its defence. While the 18th Century is seen as the “age of Enlightenment”, the Reformation and Counter-Reformation had yet to play themselves out completely and the Church’s place in the hearts of men, affairs of state and God’s universe was still open to argument. In parts of Europe, the Catholic Church was still a tremendous force for social, political and scientific conservatism.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Skirm_Nizam_I_Cedit_Rifles	\\n\\nFighting in formal order with disciplined fire is a new idea for Turkish forces: the traditional method simply involved brave, heavily armed men hurling themselves at the enemy. This “new model” army is a break with the past, and it has even adopted Western-style military dress. Despite these modernisations the Nizam-I Cedit remain vulnerable to cavalry charges and when in prolonged close combat. They are best used in a loose skirmish formation, where their marksmanship and rifles can be used to the full.\\n\\nHistorically, the Nizam-I Cedit reforms were made vital by the poor performance of Ottoman armies against the Russians. The Ottomans’ inability to defend their empire against a growing Slavic threat, and predatory moves by other European powers, were reason enough for Turkey to be known as the “sick man of Europe”. Help came from an unlikely source: anxious for allies, the French Revolutionary Republic provided much of the expertise to retrain the Ottoman army. However, the reforms met with opposition from the ultra-conservative janissaries; eventually the janissaries had to be disbanded.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_Prussian_Life_Hussars	\\n\\nLike other light cavalrymen, hussars have speed, “dash” and an elitist attitude towards their enemies and friends. The Life Hussars are, without exception, superb horsemen, and all have a certain independence of spirit that makes them ideal for chasing down widely scattered enemies and scouting duties. They carry curved sabres and, even though their charge is a fairly powerful attack, they are relatively weak when pitted against infantry in square and against heavy cavalry units.\\n\\nOne of Prussia’s most famous generals, Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, began his military career as a hussar. Swedish by birth, he joined the Swedish army at the age of 16 but transferred his allegiance to Prussia after he was captured in 1760. However, a slight tendency towards excess meant he was often passed over for promotion, leading him to resign his commission in 1773. Upon receiving this resignation Frederick the Great was reported to say “Captain Blücher can take himself to the devil.” He was blacklisted, and Blücher was unable to rejoin the army until after the death of Frederick. Once back, he distinguished himself, going on to play one of the key roles in the Allied victory at Waterloo.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tSecret1_gentlemens_club_spain	\\n\\nA member's club is a sanctuary, a place to escape everyday life and spend some time with like-minded fellows. They are also quiet, private places, where secrets can be shared and deals done out of sight of others. They are, in fact, breeding grounds for intrigue, gossip, and double-dealing, making them the perfect breeding ground for unsavoury spies and provocateurs.\\n\\nHistorically, member's clubs first appeared in London towards the end of the 18th century. They were highly exclusive in their early years and provided the upper classes with somewhere to gamble, technically an illegal pastime. However, gambling was the least of many evils practised in these clubs. Perhaps the most infamous of these societies was the Hellfire Club, originally established in London in 1719 by the Duke of Wharton, simply for the purposes of debauchery. In 1735, the Irish Hellfire Club was established, and went on to outdo its predecessor in as many foul ways as possible. These included paying defrocked priests to perform mock Catholic masses, sacrificing cats to Satan and, allegedly, on one occasion offering up a dwarf in a diabolic sacrifice. To this day, no one is entirely sure why a dwarf was considered appropriate.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1110707136	After taking Alexandria from the Mamelukes, France must focus immediate attention on the Mameluke leader, Murad Bey, who will rally his troops at Cairo. Killing him is essential to victory in Egypt. It is very likely that the Ottoman Empire will soon march its armies south into their Egyptian territory. The forts of Arish, Jaffa and Acre are the main strongholds along their route, so to successfully stall their advance you must capture each of them. Whilst the Ottoman military presence is not particularly strong in the Levant, be on your guard, as the High Porte will surely send reinforcements from Anatolia and Greece. These elite troops are trained in the European style of warfare, and are known as the Nizam-I-Cedit. To make matters worse, the British have sent one of their most capable admirals, Horatio Nelson, to the eastern Mediterranean to block your escape routes. No French supplies or reinforcements can arrive while the British naval base on Cyprus is active, and remember that your enemies can not only attack you by land, but also by sea. Make sure all your newly acquired towns and cities are well defended, so there are no nasty surprises to check French progress in the region.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sAdmin4_court_appeals_european	\\n\\nThe court is the power of the state rendered in magnificent fashion and, even if appeals are successful, it helps keep order by greatly adding to the repression in the region. Given that the state acts as prosecutor and pays the judges, who understand where their duty lies, it is also an effective way of punishing those who choose not to support the state. Legal sanctions back demands for tax, and there may be little point in a man arguing against them. The courts also have the power to enforce military demands for recruits.\\n\\nWithout an appeals procedure, courts of law had no means of self-correction or review: the decision of the judge was absolute and final. Appeals to a king, consul or president were sometimes possible, but executive mercy was often whimsical and based on social position or political expediency. In theory, an appeals court removed politics and social standing from the application of law, although in practice this was rarely the case. Simply put: a gentleman or merchant had the money to pay for an appeal, while a poor man did not. This one fact alone made the courts a subtle tool of social repression and control.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sArmy2_barracks_european	\\n\\nBarracks provide housing, armouries, and stabling for most kinds of soldiers and their mounts, along with the space necessary for them to be trained in the basics of military life.  Sensibly, they are usually also designed to be defensible, even if there are town walls, and an imposing symbol of government solidity and power. The barracks are a bulwark for the power of the ruling classes: the local authorities can send men to deal with all enemies, foreign and domestic. The place can even serve as a prison, should the locals prove troublesome!\\n\\nMany governments at the start of the 19th Century were still using troops for domestic policing duties, particularly against troublemakers in the new industrial factory towns that were appearing. Soldiers were there to keep order and, in doing so, protect the property of the wealthy middle and upper classes. This did not mean that having troops barracked in a town was popular, even among those they were defending. While it might be acceptable to invite a captain of dragoons to dine, soldiers were a group apart and considered a necessary, sometimes very necessary, evil. The popularity of soldiers was always tied to the perceived threats from foreign nations.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Frigate_24	\\n\\nThis 24-gun ship is not a ship-of-the-line, and would not last long in combat against such an opponent. Rather than heavy firepower, it is built for speed and easy handling; the guns on board are much lighter than those used by even the smallest battle ship. A frigate is not suited to close combat, its hull and masts would not survive a heavy enemy broadside. Instead, their advantage lies in the long range qualities of their relatively accurate 9-pounder guns, and their manoeuvrability against lumbering ships. They can, quite simply, outmanoeuvre larger opponents, and choose to run if the odds are against them.\\n\\nHistorically, a frigate’s guns were all mounted together on a single deck well above the waterline. Warships often had their guns split between the upper and lower decks, and during rough weather would have to close the lower gun ports to prevent swamping. A frigate had no guns close to the waterline, so was not handicapped by this problem and could deploy all its guns all the time. A frigate was seen as a desirable posting for a young officer, as it offered the chance of prize money and the chance to be noticed as a dashing and brave commander.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Irreg_Ottoman_Azzars	\\n\\nLittle more than a rabble, these men are an erratic and unpredictable enemy for line infantry, and they are good at hiding in a variety of terrain types. They lack the necessary skills to fight well in close combat, instead working better at range, in short, sharp sniping attacks. However, if they are forced into a prolonged exchange of fire with regular light or line infantry they will be the weaker force. Cavalry units also pose a real threat to the azzars, as they lack even basic discipline.\\n\\nHistorically, Azzars had little to do with standard military protocols, practice, or even organisation, often taking up arms in extraordinary circumstances. The lack of discipline meant that they could sometimes be extremely brutish in their behaviour. It often worked in their favour, in that it gave enemies pause for thought. More typically, however, their lack of discipline counted against them and, when faced with a well-ordered force, they were at a disadvantage. However, their mobility was a boon, allowing them to harass an enemy and withdraw as soon as the fight went against them.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sRoads1_basic_roads_european	\\n\\nSome effort is put into maintaining the main roads, improving the carriageway and providing working drainage for rainwater. If nothing else, the building of roads is a useful way of getting some value from the feckless, workshy, and undeserving poor. Honest men who pay their taxes expect some return for their support of the naturally indolent and the unfortunates who have been thrown out of work.\\n\\nHistorically, there was also a military imperative to improve roads, even if the change was from a rutted cart track to a smooth cart track. Troops and artillery require good roads for strategic redeployments and rapid responses to enemy or rebellious activity. It is far easier to haul artillery pieces along any kind of road rather than across country. With the Enlightenment’s conscious harking back to the Classical era, there was also a desire to emulate the achievements of Rome, even in something as small as roadways.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_roads_dust_tracks	\\n\\nAs a means of travel, the main benefit of a track is that it leads somewhere, probably – without local knowledge, it can be difficult to tell! Without signposts or markers, there is little to distinguish one path from another. Even local knowledge of a route can be limited, because locals rarely travel further than the nearest market town and possibly not even that far. The actual going is a little better than across open ground because at least large rocks and bushes have been removed. In wet weather, however, it may be considerably worse as the track turns to a muddy streambed.\\n\\nHistorically, these roads were often little more than drover’s tracks or country lanes that have been worn into the landscape by centuries of use. While perfectly adequate to local needs, they were not suitable for military purposes: heavy cannons in particular require solid going if they are to be moved at more than a snail’s pace, or at all!	false

When an external threat is greater than personal gain, men who once thought of naught but their purses can become quite patriotic!\\n\\nHistorically, the war against the French took a turn for the worse in 1810, forcing the Spanish government to retreat towards Cádiz. It became obvious that the centralised junta system had failed and that new leadership was required. The Cortes of Cádiz began work on a constitution and, after two years of deliberation between the liberal and conservative elements that made up the Cortes, a new Spanish Constitution was signed in 1812. Its central purpose was to limit the power of the monarchy, thus preventing any future corrupt monarchs from claiming any right to absolute rule. It proved so effective that it became the template for other, liberal Latin nations seeking change.	false

technologies_long_description_military3_counter_guerrilla_initiatives	\\n\\nThe Spanish countryside is a dangerous place to be French. Guerrilla bands are everywhere, looking to take more ears as trophies. It is only sensible then, for the French army to seek assistance anywhere it can be found, including from among those Spaniards willing to co-operate. These men tend to be criminals, or have nothing left to lose, as little else could drive a man to fight his guerrilla brethren.\\n\\nAs the war in Spain dragged to a close, and the French began their withdrawal, some of the guerrillas that had helped to liberate their country turned against their own people. The idea of meekly working in the fields was not attractive to men who had made a steady living by looting convoys and dead Frenchmen. Some became little better than highwaymen, and helped Spain be seen as a lawless place. In an attempt to re-establish the rule of law, the Spanish government had to send troops against the guerrillas. It took decades for the problem to be ended; Spain’s national police, the Guardia Civil, were originally raised to deal with the guerrilla issue.	false

For instance, in the recently re-conquered Hungary and Croatia you may be required to immediately restore public order to satisfactory levels, along with missionaries to halt the spread of Islam in those regions. These regions certainly require urgent military reinforcement. Protestantism is spreading like a disease through the German regions of Rhineland, Hannover, and Saxony - and although many people still follow the true religion, in some cases their heretical rulers do not. If too many of the population convert to Protestantism, invade their territory and bring the true religion back to the people. There may also be the possibility of expansion to the north and east, especially if Protestant Prussia tries to unite German-speaking lands under their banner. They may also try to partition Poland for the same reason. If this occurs Russia could also act against Poland, so it may be necessary to invade Poland to prevent the Prussian and Russian empires from becoming too large.	false

Admittance to the ranks was extremely tough and, because only the very best gained entry, it could also boast the very best gunners in Europe.

Though very precise, it does have the disadvantage of being vulnerable to fast moving cavalry and melee attacks. The soldiers who man these guns should not be expected to defend themselves in melee for very long: they are gunners, not warriors. Their power lies in the cannons, so placing them at a safe distance from the fray is advisable.\\n\\nHistorically, the French army owed the success of its artillery to Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. The son of a magistrate, he entered the French Royal Artillery as a volunteer, and quickly rose through the ranks. After becoming lieutenant-general and commander of the order of St Louis in 1765, he fell out of favour with the royal court and only returned in 1776, when he obtained the position of first inspector of artillery. It was during this time that he began a series of reforms that revolutionised French cannon production. His Gribeauval System of standardised components was adopted by other nations, including the United States.	false

technologies_long_description_admin2_afrancesado_propaganda	\\n\\nAt best, most Spaniards dislike the French. There are some, the Afrancesados, who see merit in the Revolution and in Bonapartism. Many are members of the gentry who followed French customs during the time of Carlos III. They now hope to lead Spain into a new age of Enlightenment. With the help of these Spanish sympathisers, the French have a much easier time persuading the population that French rule is worthwhile. Controlling a region can become significantly easier.\\n\\n“Afrancesado” is a Spanish term for those people who followed French fashions and customs. It quickly changed into a term, of disapproval usually, for those members of the Spanish gentry who swore allegiance to the new, French-imposed, King Joseph. The Afrancesados tried to argue their case, and even had a hand in the creation of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, but to little effect. Once it became clear that Napoleon’s armies had lost control in Spain the Afrancesados were forced to flee, protected by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan’s army.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_steam_drydock_european	\\n\\nThe kind of beam engines used to pump water around a canal system (and drain mines) can drain a drydock efficiently. Using steam to power these engines is an obvious step, but once steam engines are in a dockyard their use goes far beyond pumping seawater around. \\n\\nThey can be used to drive sawmills, lathes, even block-making machines and as the lifting power for dockside cranes. The efficiency gains – admittedly with some new risk of fire, as the main shipbuilding material is wood – are impressive! \\n\\nThe scale of the military-naval industry could be huge in maritime nations, even discounting civilian yards. The British Royal Navy dockyards were the largest industrial organisation in the world during the 18th Century, and could make every part of a warship from a mast to a nail; guns were the exception, as they came from the Board of Ordnance. The ropewalk at Chatham, Kent, produced anchor ropes and was the longest brick building in Europe when constructed. It is still producing high quality ropes for ships today. The dockyards were so important that damaging them by fire or explosion carried the death penalty – something not actually repealed until 1971 (two years after the UK death penalty was finally abolished for murder).	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Frigate_38	\\n\\nThis frigate is the largest design of the type, and the relatively heavy 18-pounders it carries balance both firepower and reasonable accuracy. Against another frigate, the 38 is a dangerous opponent, but in close combat against a ship-of-the-line it is outmatched: like all frigates, it has been built for speed, not hull strength. In battle against a powerful enemy the best strategy is to keep out of range, and choose when and where to engage, taking advantage of the fact that the crew can reload the 18-pounders relatively quickly.\\n\\nHistorically, frigates were usually involved in single-ship actions, against other frigates rather than set-piece fleet battles involving ships-of-the-line. In fact, it was seen as ungentlemanly for a ship-of-the-line to fire upon a frigate, unless the frigate fired first. In such a case, the frigate captain had shown that he was ready for a fight that he was unlikely to win. This was not the only quirky rule of naval combat in the period. It was common to “clear for action” and put the captain’s furniture in a ship’s boat that was towed during any fight. It was considered very unsporting for an enemy to shoot at a captain’s private property!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_great_arsenal_european	\\n\\nThe development of new cannons is an expensive and sometimes risky business, and one that the state likes to keep under its immediate control. No government likes to contemplate rebellion, but central control of heavy artillery and its production is a wise policy. Rebels without cannons are an annoyance: with large guns, rebels can become revolutionaries!\\n\\nLarge guns are necessary for armies (and navies, for that matter) to operate effectively. The ability of a nation to project its power in war is, in large part, measured by the size and variety of its artillery train.\\n\\nHistorically, the arsenals of many states were peacetime stores for cannons, shot and powder; domestic peacekeeping by an army rarely required artillery. Once cast, a cannon barrel could spend decades in storage before being mounted on a carriage and used in anger. Gunpowder, too, could spend neglected years in storage, and this caused all kinds of problems when it was finally issued to gunners. Money for the upkeep of stores also caused problems, too often ending up in the pockets of the Masters of Ordnance and his friends!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Frigate_32	\\n\\nThis square-rigged ship is armed with 12-pounders on the only gun deck. The cannons it carries do not have the same punch as the guns found on larger ships, but they are more than capable of damaging smaller ships. The speed and handling characteristics of a 32-gun frigate allow it to choose when and where to engage a slower enemy. Whereas most ships must blast away at close range, this frigate can pepper an enemy at a distance.\\n\\nThe first 32-gun frigates were introduced in 1756 and classed as “fifth rates” by the Royal Navy. The Southampton-class of frigates were British built and had more headroom on the lower deck than the French frigate models. British frigates had been derived from the French designs: the British were impressed with the French design, and copied captured examples for their own fleet. Although not usually commanded by a full captain, a frigate was a desirable ship for an ambitious officer as it gave him a taste of independent command.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_pNavy1_shipyard_european	\\n\\nDockyards are small industrial villages in their own right, and usually have all the tradesmen and artisans needed to get a ship built on site and permanently employed. They have extensive workshops such as ropewalks, smithies, sawmills and furnaces; the skilled craftsmen include coopers, sailmakers, chandlers and master carpenters. There are also large stocks of timber held in seasoning sheds. Seasoning, the process of slowly drying out sap, can take months or years, so wood is laid up anticipating future demands.\\n\\nHistorically, losing a dockyard to enemy action, even for a short time during a raid, was often a disaster. Apart from the damage to ships in harbour, the loss of timber stocks was far, far worse. The fixed workshops could be replaced, given money, but the timber was gone for good. Loss of these stocks set back shipbuilding by many years, and meant that battle damage was hard to repair. It must have gone against the instincts of many naval officers to burn a dockyard and its contents rather than loot it and purloin any ships for prize money, but they did it anyway!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sheep_clearances_european	\\n\\nTenanted farms can only generate so much income from rents. With an increase in town size, and an increased demand from industry for agricultural products, it is more profitable to have herds of animals, not a gaggle of tenants. Meat and wool demand increases rapidly as towns grow. Apart from any other considerations, moving people off land also creates large areas where landowners can indulge a passion for hunting. While this generates little income, it does give social status.\\n\\nThe “Highland Clearances” are probably the most famous example of a forced change to land usage on a large scale. Contrary to popular belief, Highland clan leaders carried out most of the Scottish clearances, driving their own kinsmen and clans into exile. The chieftains needed to pay for the sophisticated life that they could have in Edinburgh and London by reinventing themselves as Scottish gentry. Sheep simply earned more money than the crofters did.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_-1109259521	Your first priority should be to protect your European possessions outside Spain itself. Flanders, Milan, Sardinia, Naples and Sicily are under threat from Protestants in the north and marauding Muslim powers in the Mediterranean. You will need to expand your armed forces in order to protect them. The heretic United Provinces have already risen up and reclaimed part of their homeland, it may only be a matter of time before they move against Flanders, so building up your forces there may also be wise - although provoking the French or British by your actions there may be unavoidable. In addition to its European possessions, Spain should also maintain trade routes to its Caribbean colonies and the protectorate of New Spain - at the same time protecting them from both the United Provinces and Britain, who are very active in the region. Given the chance, rogue states such as these will cut you off from a major source of your wealth, so destroying their activities here may be the way forward.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_3_Decker_British_Heavy_1st_Rate	\\n\\nLike most large ships-of-the-line, this vessel is a terrifying sight for enemies and with good reason: its broadside is enormous. Each side of the ship, let alone the whole thing, has more guns than many land armies can boast! Such firepower, however, makes the ship heavy and cumbersome under sail. This is little comfort to those caught by its broadside. Equally, the price of the vessel and its high upkeep costs are little comfort to enemies either.\\n\\nHistorically, ships as large and heavily protected as this over-sized first rate were incredibly expensive to maintain and required a large crew. They were often used as admiral’s flagships, as there was plenty of room for the admiral and his staff. The term flagship originates from the officers' custom of hanging distinctive pennants to denote their presence. These flags were often rather large: Lord Howe’s Union flag for use aboard his Royal Navy ship was 12-by-17 feet in size.	false

Improve trade routes with the west and foster good relations with Britain, France, Austria, and Prussia - updating your armed forces in line with their latest military doctrines. In terms of expansion, the lands of Poland-Lithuania - directly to the west - could easily become part of a greater Russian Empire, as could the regions of Scandinavia should Sweden force a war and be defeated.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Prussian_Cuirassiers	\\n\\nThe primary task of cuirassiers is to crash into enemy forces and engage in close-combat. Unlike the cuirassiers of other nations, Prussians disdain the heavy cuirasses worn as protection, relying instead on cold hard steel of their heavy straight swords to win the argument. They nonetheless keep the name. A wise commander with a cuirassier force under his command uses it as a battering ram to hit the enemy at the critical point and is careful not to unleash them too soon or against unshaken, superior troops.\\n\\nHistorically, Frederick William II issued the order that forbade cuirassiers from wearing the cuirass in 1790. A couple of regiments had already forsaken their heavy armour three years earlier but this order specifically forbade all regiments from wearing the cuirass. The ban remained in place until 1814-1815 when cuirassiers were once again allowed to wear armour, predominantly pieces captured from French troops.\\n\\nCuirassiers still exist in modern armies, although their armour is now purely ceremonial. The French army still has two regiments of cuirassiers, the Italians have a Presidential Honour Guard and, technically, the Household Cavalry in the British army are also cuirassiers.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_British_Highland_Foot	\\n\\nRaised from among the fierce people of the Scottish Highlands, these men are the embodiment of the savagery of their clan forebears and the savage discipline of British marching regiments. They fight well, whether giving fire to an enemy, or the bayonet, and Scottish pride gives them a bloody-minded streak that means they rarely break and run. Like other line regiments, they must adopt square formation when attacked by cavalry.\\n\\nThe Highland regiments that fought in the Napoleonic Wars were based on the independent companies that were raised to keep order after the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. The suppression of the rebellion was a brutal business, and the highlanders who joined were brutal, hard men. In regular service, they became solid, dependable and brave: men who could be relied on to fight on, no matter what was happening around them. The 42nd “Black Watch”, for example, held off repeated French assaults at the Battle of Corunna in 1809, giving the British army time to escape from the port.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tSupply1_supply_post_european	\\n\\nAn army marches only because the bellies of the soldiers and horses are full and their feet are properly shod. A supply post exists to keep supplies flowing into an army, all the military necessities that cannot be taken from the enemy’s lands by foraging. This is the responsibility of the commissariats, although many field officers would argue that their only mission in life is keeping their account books in order!\\n\\nThe great soldier-king, Frederick the Great of Prussia, entirely grasped the need for a properly organised system of supplies for his campaigns in Silesia. His rigid tactical system was almost obsolete by the Napoleonic period; indeed, the Prussian army suffered dreadfully for keeping to it when facing French armies. His supply methods, however, including the creation of extensive supply dumps along lines of advance, were a triumph that every general would have done well to study.	false

technologies_long_description_admin2_national_census	\\n\\nBy counting everyone in the population, a government can tax everyone; possibly taxation will be unfair, but it will be unfair to all. It also becomes possible for a government to monitor the movement of people from the countryside to towns, calculate how fast the population is growing, and even know if there will be enough men for an army. However, the most immediate impact is on tax: a census increases the tax yield.\\n\\nCounting people and taxation have been linked since at least Biblical times. The Directory, under Napoleon’s Consulate, carried out very successful censuses in post-revolutionary France, allowing them to collect taxes effectively and, just as vitally for Napoleon’s ambitions, know how many men were available for conscription. In Britain, the National Census was the result of work by Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) on population growth. He was convinced that a crisis was looming as the number of people outstripped the available food supply. The 1800 Census Act resulted in the British government knowing that there were nine million people in the country; this probably wasn’t all that satisfactory, as it was just over a third of the number of Frenchmen in France.	false

technologies_long_description_economy2_joint_stock_company	\\n\\nJoint stock companies allow a business to raise money quickly. The people who provide the money have shares in any subsequent profits and own the enterprise even if they do not manage it. They can sell their stake in the company as they see fit, for whatever price they can get, so creating a stock market. Shareholder investment reduces the construction cost of industrial and mining buildings, and boosts the growth of national wealth.\\n\\nHistorically, joint stock companies are the basis of a capitalist economic system, but have always had dire results for some investors. The easy profits to be made in trading stocks and shares encourage rampant speculation that may be entirely unconnected to the actual value of what is being traded. Stocks have also been “talked up” and sold unfairly by unscrupulous investors. The South Sea Bubble of 1711 in Britain and the Mississippi Company Bubble of 1721 in France both resulted from what would, today, be termed criminal insider dealing and insanely greedy speculation by too many eager “marks”. However, when used honestly, the stocks-and-shares system remains a fine way of raising capital to do business while compensating those whose money is at risk.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tEducation1_college_european	\\n\\nA college offers an academic education, perhaps a veneer of sophistication, to the sons of the aristocracy, the gentry, and the merchant classes. It may also, unintentionally, expose these people to the dangerous concept of thinking about the world, and that can create a wish for reform, if the world’s many injustices are considered.\\n\\nHistorically, a college education usually required substantial wealth, as there were scholarships or charitable places for the talented poor. Although science and philosophy were on the curriculum, the ideas taught were usually socially and politically conservative rather than radical. College masters were unlikely to see any reasons for upsetting the wealthy parents of their scholars, and most students saw no reason to question their entrenched privileges. Radicalism was confined to a small number of students, or came out in rebellious and extremely bad behaviour involving local taverns, bawdyhouses, and “actresses”. Rebellion could always be curbed by a dose of the pox, or a threat from father to cut off an allowance!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Light_Ottoman_Nizam_I_Cedit_Light_Infantry	\\n\\nFighting in a formal way with tight control and disciplined fire is a new idea for Turkish troops. The traditional method has involved brave men hurling themselves pell-mell at the enemy with no thought of defeat. The Nizam-I Cedit still fight bravely, but with Western tactics. They have adopted a combination of formations used by Western light infantry, and can switch quickly between skirmishing and a regular firing line.\\n\\nHistorically, the Nizam-I Cedit reforms were made vital by the repeatedly poor performance of the Ottoman army in battle against Russians. The empire’s inability to defend itself against growing threats was the reason Turkey became known as the “sick man of Europe”. The French Revolutionary Republic, anxious for any allies no matter how unlikely, provided military expertise to the Ottomans. The retraining of the army was not without problems: the janissaries resented their loss of position, privileges and influence.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Polish_Legion	\\n\\nThe Legion may be regarded as socially inferior and paid less than other infantry, but they fight like the Devil when asked. They will honourably withstand shot, shell and sabre and then go forwards with courage to drive off enemies. Armed with muskets and bayonets, they can steadily fire volleys into the mass of an enemy army, or fix bayonets and attack at close quarters. They may lack the pomp of other infantry, but they do all that is asked.\\n\\nThe Poles were ardent supporters of Napoleon and saw him as a liberator. This admiration was mutual; the Emperor declared that his Polish Legion infantry were to be treated with the same respect as their French equivalents. The Polish infantry excelled in defensive tactics, choosing to avoid the mass assaults the French favoured. As a result they were less vulnerable to artillery attacks, and were even known to sit down under fire to reduce their vulnerability!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rFarm1_farms_european	\\n\\nTenanted farms primarily produce cash crops. The landlord expects his rent to be paid, but successful tenants who develop the land can become quietly wealthy men. They may be able to buy their farms.\\n\\nHistorically, tenanted farms made a good profit but, like all farming, were subject to the vagaries of the weather. Crops failed with terrible regularity, forcing up food prices and causing social unrest.\\n\\nTenancies could be, and were, passed down the generations of families, something that allow tenants to see a point in developing “their” land with their cash surplus. For a landlord the main benefit of tenanted farms was the income. Landlords could live the high life in a city and rarely needed to trouble themselves with the mud and muck of the countryside, at least as long as they had trustworthy agents and tenants! A leisured class of “gentlemen farmers” and rentiers therefore arose, all thanks to the efforts of tenant farmers. As a class, landowners suffered terribly in the French Revolution as the peasants who actually did all the work took bloody revenge for years of ill treatment.	false

technologies_long_description_military2_army_corps_organisation	\\n\\nA corps structure introduces an extra level of command, aiding a commanding general by, counter-intuitively, giving him fewer direct subordinates. Rather than dealing with dozens of regimental commanders directly, a general issues his orders to his corps commanders. The general is then free from the burden of dealing with many people, and can concentrate on the overall situation. Each corps operates as an army in miniature, looking after its own supplies and marching routes. One immediately noticeable effect is an improvement in movement rates for armies, because individual units can now be coordinated in detail.\\n\\nThe corps structure, grouping together army divisions, was not new in the Napoleonic era, but again Napoleon’s genius was to take an existing concept and gain the maximum benefit. Following the Revolutionary War, divisions in the French army were organised into temporary groups known as “wings”. Command of a wing was temporary, and on top of a divisional general’s responsibilities. A sensible evolution of the idea was to make the “Corps D'Armée” a permanent formation, with its own staff and permanent commanding officer. Each corps usually had at least two infantry divisions with their own artillery, a corps artillery reserve, and at least a brigade of cavalry.	false

Their presence and reputation has a positive effect on friendly troops, encouraging them on in any dark hours! Unfailing discipline means these men have excellent accuracy and their reload times are almost unrivalled; however, these skills make them an expensive unit; they are also vulnerable, just like lesser men, to artillery and skirmishers.\\n\\nIn 1809 Napoleon raised two units of Vélites from Turin and Florence in Italy. They were raised from well-to-do families; any man with an income of less than 300 francs was overlooked. This recruitment process was a masterstroke from Napoleon: by recruiting units from the middle and upper classes, and by giving their sons positions of power, he ensured the continued support of the influential classes. He continued to buy support from these people by posting their children to the guard and other units where they would see minimal action but still get to wear a lovely uniform.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rFarm3_great_estates_european	\\n\\nLarge estates are a statement of wealth, complete with dazzling palace-sized grand houses built without thought to the expense. Landowners and the great nobility vie with each other to produce not just houses, but also idealized landscapes around them. Where the terrain is not dramatic enough, it is ruthlessly reorganised to suit the owner’s tastes, and to the misery of the lower classes who are forced leave their homes to make way for deer parks and Classical follies.\\n\\nHistorically, a group of landscape architects in Europe completely remodelled many country estates into idyllically perfect vistas for their clients. They created the fantasy of a natural landscape, improving on what was there to make entirely “artificial” (and this was not a term of disapproval at the time) parkland dotted with romantic ruins and follies. In the process, men like Lancelot “Capability” Brown remade hills, flooded valleys, moved rivers, destroyed entire villages and displaced people without mercy. Many of these amazing houses and gardens still exist today as tourist attractions.	false

technologies_long_description_admin1_public_schooling	\\n\\nEducation is usually the preserve of wealthy and ambitious families: the aristocracy have little need for it, because it adds no lustre to their titles; the poor have little use for it, because it rarely puts bread in their bellies. Education must be bought, and schools are generally run as privately-owned businesses. Public schooling introduces the idea of the state paying for the education of its people, sometimes regardless of their backgrounds: a radical notion in many ways. Public schooling provides a bonus to research, and increases the spawning rate of agents.\\n\\nGeneral state-funded public education was fiercely resisted in many influential quarters across Europe, as it was feared that teaching the poor to read would only encourage them in seditious thoughts. Britain is an oddity in that its “public” schools are nothing of the sort. They are private business establishments, where money rather than ability secures a place. The name came about because “public” schools would accept anyone who could pay, as opposed to “private” schools that accepted pupils by invitation only.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Spanish_Coraceros_Espanoles	\\n\\nThe flash of the Coraceros Españoles’ swords, and the gleam of their breastplates, may very well be the last thing an enemy ever sees, such is the finality of their charge! They are relatively slow moving because they are heavyweights, but when it comes to punching holes in an enemy’s defences, they are almost unmatched. Once their charge is over they can stay and fight in melee. They are exceptional warriors, and need only show due caution when facing guard cavalry or elite infantry.\\n\\nThe Coraceros Españoles claimed their uniforms, armour and weapons from captured French cuirassiers after the Battle of Mollet in 1810. A lack of funds, along with losses of men and horses during the war, often meant that the Spanish army was short of supplies, despite receiving considerable support from the British. This was particularly true for cavalry units, where some cavalrymen had to actually serve on foot due to a lack of suitable horses!	false

technologies_long_description_military5_rockets	\\n\\nA war rocket is an iron cylinder, packed with gunpowder, with a long wooden stick as a tail. It functions in much the same way as a firework, but with infinitely deadlier consequences. Launched from angled troughs or stands, rockets are not particular accurate. This does not matter when they are fired in large numbers, and their morale effect should not be underestimated. They may also have an incendiary effect on a target. Rockets are weapons for specialists, and so this technology allows the recruitment of rocket units.\\n\\nHistorically, rocketry had long been used in Indian and Asian warfare, as the British discovered during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The British, ready as always to adopt foreign ideas when it suited, soon had their own version of rockets thanks to Colonel William Congreve (1722-1828). The Congreve Rocket was introduced to British artillery in 1805 and used to intimidate the enemy and spread fire and panic amongst them. A battery of Congreve Rockets was present at Waterloo in 1815, the final epic battle of the Napoleonic period.	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Light_British_Light_Foot	\\n\\nThese light troops are trained to use their surroundings to their advantage, and use skirmish tactics to break and harass the enemy. This British regiment can also form an effective firing line when needed. The accuracy of their fire is excellent but they are weak against well-trained cavalry. Their inability to form square leaves them incredibly vulnerable; prolonged close combat is also inadvisable.\\n\\nThe British army traditionally recruited its riflemen and light troops from German states, but as France expanded into Holland in 1799, Britain was forced to rethink its recruitment strategy as the north German states were no longer quite so accessible. Many of the foreign troops in British service had perished in the West Indies or been drafted into the 60th Royal Americans. With few light troops available, General John Moore established a camp at Shorncliffe, Kent in 1802 for the instruction of light infantry. It took a year before the first unit of line infantry was converted into a British light infantry regiment.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tCommerce2_merchant_house_european	\\n\\nAs trade opens up the world, people begin to contemplate the best way to exploit commodities. A merchant house is a place for traders to gather to discuss trade and conduct business. New ways of financing their enterprises can also be tried. The merchants’ rapidly increasing finances are also looked after and reinvested in all manner of ways, benefiting the region as a whole.\\n\\nHistorically, the Rothschild banking family controlled the finances of some of the most important men of the Napoleonic era. Nathan Mayer Rothschild established his business in London and was responsible for handling the gold bullion that was sent to Wellington for his war effort in Portugal and Spain. Rothschild took a small percentage commission for handling what turned out to be millions in gold. With important, and profitable, transactions like these the Rothschilds were set up a network of family branches to handle business the world over. His connections bought Nathan Rothschild the news of Wellington’s victory at Waterloo a full day before it reached the government!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Melee_Ottoman_Cemaat_Janissaries	\\n\\nThe janissaries are the cream of the Ottoman army, but also old fashioned and outmoded by contemporary military forces. They are traditionalists in all things, and this includes making war: they value personal courage and skill, not collective discipline. They are, however, supremely dangerous fighters in close combat and when they charge home.\\n\\nHistorically, the janissaries were the “new soldiers” of the Ottoman Empire, the replacements for feudal levies and tribal warriors. Janissaries were taken into the corps as children, converted to Islam if necessary, and indoctrinated to fight and die for the Ottoman sultan. They were completely loyal, reliable and efficient, so much so that the Ottoman state came to rely on them as military governors and administrators as well as warriors. This gave them too much power and the new soldiers slowly became the entrenched conservatives who fought any further reforms. Their loyalty was such that they could even rationalise revolt against the sultan, if his policies went against what they considered the best interests of the Ottoman Empire.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_star_fort_earthworks_european	\\n\\nThe basic concept of a star fort is that at least one, and preferably many, field of fire should cover every part of the defence and the approaches to the fort. These killing zones can be extended and made even more deadly by, at the very least, a long sloping glacis around the fort for the attackers to scale. The glacis need not be very steep at all, but the attackers face an uphill struggle with no cover at all, under murderous fire ever step of the way. The glacis also acts as a passive defence, a sloping armoured earthwork for the fort proper. Beyond the glacis a hidden counterscarp awaits: a retaining wall (sometimes with firing positions for the defenders) that drops down deep ditch that must be crossed before the actual approaches to the fort are even reached!\\n\\nAll of these defences are before the military architects add additional ravelins (detached triangular bastions or gun positions) in front of the fort’s own walls and hornworks and crownworks (both elaborations on the basic bastion design). The whole effect, when viewed in plan form, is baroque in its complexity, each projection of the central star giving the defence another firing position towards any attacking force. Wall length is limited to that which can be covered by flanking musket fire, as experience showed that a fort with only cannons in its defence could be taken when the cannons were knocked out.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_French_Cuirassiers_Murat	\\n\\nThese are big men on big horses, led by Joachim Murat. They wear breastplates and reinforced helmets for protection in close combat, and can charge home with terrific force too. They carry heavy, straight swords which they can use to fearsome man-killing effect. A wise commander uses Murat’s force as a battering ram to punch a hole in an enemy line.\\n\\nJoachim Murat was executed by firing squad in 1815. He met death with the same courage he always showed in battle, rejecting the offered blindfold. Early in his career he impressed Napoleon by securing the artillery that repulsed the Royalists during the 13 Vendémiaire fighting. He was repaid by being named King of Naples and Sicily. Although brave in battle, Napoleon feared that Murat had no moral courage and little intelligence. This was the case, as he turned against his former master and, when that didn’t work, tried to ingratiate himself again.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_usa_independence_hall	\\n\\n Independence Hall in Philadelphia was actually built by the Pennsylvania colonial legislature as their State House, and so for the first two decades after completion it was home to part of the British administration in America. It is a practical, red brick building in a grand colonial style and has an architectural honesty and pleasing, human proportion to it that is sometimes lacking in grander neo-Classical structures.\\n\\nFrom 1775, the building was the home to the Second Continental Congress, the representatives of the Thirteen Colonies who approved the Declaration of Independence. The romantic view is that the “Liberty Bell” was rung to bring citizens to hear the reading of the Declaration in July 1776. Unfortunately, for romantics, historians now believe that the steeple of Independence Hall was in too bad a state to allow the ringing of any bells from the Hall. That hasn’t stopped the romantics believing the story for a minute! Independence Hall was abandoned by Congress when the British occupied Philadelphia from 1777-78. The government eventually moved to a specially created federal district (later to become Washington DC) when a mutiny by the Continental Army drove them out of Philadelphia in 1783. But for the actions of the mutineers, Philadelphia would probably still be the capital of the United States.	false

technologies_long_description_admin4_dialectics	\\n\\nDialectics attempts to resolve the conflict between two opposing arguments without proving, or disproving, either argument. As a method of debate it teaches careful and considered reasoning; the idea can be applied equally to natural philosophy, politics, law, and life generally. Dialectics provide a bonus to diplomatic relations and a bonus to research rates; scientists are armed with a new intellectual tool. It also allows the building of the best available courts and universities.\\n\\nThe concept, in the West, can be traced back to the Greek scholars of antiquity. However, it was during the explosion of free-thinking during the Enlightenment that the technique of thinking was revisited. Thanks to the enquiring mind of Georg Hegel (1770-1831), dialectics and many other advances in the practice of philosophy were promulgated. He built a comprehensive frame work around philosophical thought that would help others to understand the complexities of the human mind and its connection with nature.	false

Wine is lovingly produced, carefully aged, and sold on at a premium. Hic!\\n\\n Wine production is still subject to the vagaries of weather, soil, and time. It is quite possible for an estate to produce a truly great wine one year and a foul one the next because, while standards are improving, there are still a great many variables that are only dimly understood.\\n\\nBy the late 18th Century, the “age of prodigious boozing” was still going strong in Europe. In England, the Prince Regent set the standards for gluttony and excess, and was widely emulated by his subjects. Georgian Englishmen had bottomless gullets, even by contemporary standards, as the available water was not always fit to drink. Despite what everyone thought at the time, drink was not the cause of gout, an agonising inflammation of the joints. Gout is triggered by a high-protein diet, as favoured by the wealthier classes of the period; the liberal use of poisonous lead compounds to sweeten wine and food probably did little to help matters!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Lancer_Austrian_Ulans	\\n\\nLike all lancers, it is their weapons that give them a distinct advantage in the first seconds of contact. A unit of lancers, charging into the attack, is frightening indeed to the targets of their ire. However, a lance is not the handiest of weapons in a melee, so the ulans should break off, reform and charge anew rather than stay in hand-to-hand combat. Like all shock cavalry, they should not be thrown into ill-considered attacks against prepared or elite infantry in square formations.\\n\\nThe Austrian decision to raise lancer regiments was a consequence of conquering former Polish provinces: Polish manpower was there to be exploited, and Poles were regarded as expert lancers. The first units were raised by the order of Emperor Joseph II (1741-90), but it was under his successor, Leopold, that the first proper regiments were created. The Poles had a long tradition of fielding lancer regiments, and the Austrians made full use of this experience. Ulans were armed, dressed, and trained in a distinctly Polish style: the rank and file were also mostly Polish speakers.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_Austrian_Hungarian_Hussars	\\n\\nLike other light cavalrymen, hussars have speed, “dash”, and an elitist attitude towards enemies. Hungarian hussars are, without exception, superb equestrians, as might be expected for a Magyar force. Their organisational origin as irregular forces, reputedly recruited from brigands and bandits, gives them a certain independence of spirit and makes them ideal for chasing down skirmishers and dealing with artillery units. They carry a curved sabre and, even though their charge is effective, they are still weak against infantry formed in square.\\n\\nHistorically, Austria had raised units of irregular Magyar horsemen called “huszárok” as far back as the mid-15th Century. They had fought bravely for Matthias Corvinus, the King of Hungary and Croatia and Duke of Austria, but it was not until the 1680s that regular hussar regiments were formed. Having proved their utility in Austrian service, other nations soon copied the ideas and hussars to their own armies. Many enthusiastically adopted hussar uniform as a fashion statement for cavalrymen. In some armies, hussar uniforms grew ever more gaudy, exaggerated, and rather lewdly suggestive in the cut of their very tight breeches!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_French_Empress_Dragoons	\\n\\nTheir charge is almost irresistible, and they can fight effectively in melee with their heavy cavalry swords, but they should not be thrown away against infantry squares. Even against other cavalry, they can give a very good account of themselves. They are, however, relatively slow moving and should not be used to pursue fleeing foes. The Empress Dragoons can fight on foot, if needed, using their carbines, but they are not particularly effective as an infantry unit.\\n\\nUnder Napoleon the Imperial Guard gradually became an almost separate army; it had infantry, artillery, and cavalry components, and even its own elite units within the already-elite Guard. By any standards, the Empress Dragoons, named to honour Josàphine de Beauharnais, were an elite force. All the officers were appointed personally by Napoleon, and the rankers had to have served at least 10 years in the saddle before they were allowed to join. Every chasseur and dragoon regiment of the line in the French army had its best non-commissioned officers taken. While this undoubtedly made sure the Empress Dragoons was composed of the best of the best, it almost certainly damaged the rest of the army by removing those same veterans from their original units.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Irreg_Guerillas	\\n\\nGuerrillas are not a recognised military organisation, but bands of comrades and neighbours who have adapted banditry into a way of making war. They fight hard, working in spread out formations that make them difficult for missile troops to hit effectively. They are best when employed in ambush, or as harassing skirmishers. Their “local knowledge” means they are able to hide and appear at will, using their homeland’s hidden places to help fight against invaders. They cannot be expected to fight in carefully dressed lines like disciplined soldiers, and as such are at a disadvantage against well-trained cavalry and infantry.\\n\\nHistorically, the Spanish people had an enormous capacity for carrying on wars against foreign occupiers long after their rulers had made their peace with an invader. Guerrillas often arose as part of a rebellion; the name is Spanish, and means “little war”. When his men were bogged down, Napoleon described Spain as an “ulcer”, thanks in part to the constant partisan warfare carried on by the guerrillas. They gave the French no peace or safety, even far from the front line.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_drill_school_european	\\n\\nIn an age when all battlefield manoeuvres must be performed exactly, drill is a necessary part of all military training. Constant repetition of the actions involved in loading and firing a piece are useful in themselves, but of more use is the unthinking obedience to superiors that is, literally, drilled into every man in the ranks. When a soldier is concentrating on his place in line and on not attracting the attention of his sergeant or officer, he will not worry about what the enemy might be doing. Drill has another benefit for an army too: men busy on the parade ground cannot be getting into trouble or finding a tavern!\\n\\nIn Britain, one aspect of 18th Century drill survives to this day in the form of a ceremonial parade called “Trooping the Colour”, carried out on the monarch’s official birthday on Horse Guards, in London. Originally, this parade was not a celebration but a practical exercise: the men needed to know what “the colours”, or flags, of their unit looked like. The fact that the monarch gets to review the soldiers is not the point! In battle, the men would need to be able to rally to, and then defend, these colours on command.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_poland_akademia	\\n\\nHistorically, the Akademia, or Szkoła Rycerska, was the Knights’ School or the Nobles’ Academy of Cadets. It was the first state school in Poland, established by King Stanislaw August Poniatowski, the last elected monarch of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1765. King Stanislaw had an abiding belief in the worth of education, both to the individual and the state. Surrounded by enemies, he did his best to advance Polish interests.\\n\\nOne of the more interesting officer cadets was Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746-1817). Benjamin Franklin recruited him to serve in the Continental Army, and he was appointed as head (military) engineer. His contributions at Ticonderoga and Saratoga, among other occasions, eventually lead to his promotion to brigadier general. He was also given citizenship, land and a large cash grant. To his eternal credit, he used his reward money to help black slaves achieve their freedom. Not satisfied with that, he returned home to Poland and organised a rising against the occupying Russians, although this ended in failure. Tsar Paul I, however, obviously thought him important and influential: in return for an oath of loyalty, 20,000 Polish prisoners of war were freed. Before his death in exile in 1815, Kościuszko had also freed all his serfs in Poland.	false

The speed provided by their mounts mean these men can reach areas of the battlefield significantly quicker than their counterparts on foot. However, their speed and versatility is no protection if they find themselves in close combat; if pitted against line infantry they will suffer heavy losses.\\n\\nHistorically, the mounted Nizam-I Cedit were known as the Neferi Nizam-I Cedit, or the 2nd Orta provincial militia. Shortly after being raised, the 1st Orta felt the wrath of the British Ambassador, who was angered by the fact that the units of this new model army were issued with French instead of British muskets! His displeasure was the least of their problems. Although sanctioned by the sultan, the modernisation of the army was met with hostility from Ottoman traditionalists. The bayonet, for example, was a serious bone of contention: many chose to see it as a way of reducing proud warriors to little more than parts in a machine.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_Mamelukes	\\n\\nMounted on seemingly tireless light horses and armed with scimitars, they are commonly employed to harass an enemy force, restricting its space to manoeuvre easily. Once battle is fully joined, they will often time their charges to coincide with those of a supporting infantry unit, seeking to break the enemy quickly then wreak havoc amongst them as they flee. Their only real weakness is when facing well-trained European infantry capable of forming square.\\n\\nMamelukes were traditionally slave-soldiers of the various caliphs and sultans of the Middle Ages, captured as children and raised in the Islamic faith to provide their master with a force of men unconnected to any part of the social hierarchy. Over time, the Mamelukes accrued power of their own and even went as far as seizing control of Egypt, founding a Mameluke Sultanate in 1250. Though the Mamelukes’ strength enabled the Sultanate to repel several invasions by Christian crusaders and Mongols, they were eventually overpowered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and entered into the service of the Sublime Porte.	false

An enterprise of this size greatly improves export capacity and increases trade value; it also improves the wealth of town and region each turn. The improved ship building capacity provided by this port also increases the number of sea trade routes that can be utilised. Unfortunately, the happiness of the lower classes is greatly affected by their unpleasant working conditions in the company enterprises.\\n\\nHistorically, the great East India companies of Britain, France and the Netherlands were armed, quasi-independent mercantile states. The British East India Company was wealthy almost beyond imagining: its trade represented about one-sixth of the British national income. Like the French “Compagnie française pour le commerce des Indes orientales” and Dutch “Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie”, the “John Company” had its own fleet and army. In India it fought wars and had its own foreign policy, giving the British government little choice but to support its actions.

building_description_texts_long_description_tSecret3_masonic_lodge_spain	\\n\\nA Masonic lodge is an ideal meeting place for like-minded people to discuss many important and secret matters. Although primarily for the upper and middle classes, a Masonic lodge does improve the happiness of the lower classes. Perhaps they are pleased that their betters are too busy to be regularly horsewhipping them for impudence…\\n\\nThe first Grand Lodge of the Freemasons was established in England in 1717, when four lodges came together at the Goose and Gridiron Ale House in St Paul’s churchyard. Just a few years later in 1723 James Anderson wrote ‘The Constitutions of the Free-masons’, and laid out the rules by which the fraternity would be governed. In this document he traced the history of “the craft” all the way back to the Old Testament. Whatever its origins, Masonry spread across Europe with some rapidity during the Age of the Enlightenment, prompting warnings from the Catholic Church and suspicion from both revolutionaries and arch-conservatives.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Art_Horse_French_Artillerie_a_Cheval	\\n\\nIn horse artillery units everyone in the gun crews rides into battle: drivers ride the lead horses in teams, while gun crews sit on the gun limbers. The Artillerie à Cheval represent a good balance between speed of movement and firepower. The crews are highly experienced and disciplined, and their intimate knowledge of the guns enables them to deliver accurate, devastating shots at long range.\\n\\nHistorically, these men and their cannons were part of Napoleon’s Imperial Guard, and held in the highest regard by the emperor. Admittance to the Imperial Guard was extremely tough and, because only the very experienced or very good gained entry, the Guard could boast of the very best gunners in Europe. The horse artillery division was the elite within the elite, and got the best of everything. When the supply of suitable horses ran low in 1815, Napoleon ordered his Horse Grenadiers to give up their mounts to be draft animals for his beloved horse artillery.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tGuns2_musket_manufactury_european	\\n\\nCentralising the provision of weapons is a sensible thing to do when raising large armies. Equipping recruits with standardised items standardises weapons drill and unit tactics, and thereby improves the recruitment of military units. While the rank and file make do with government-made weapons, it is usual for officers to purchase their own equipment. Many craft-based armaments firms can thrive by making bespoke items for wealthy gentlemen.\\n\\nHistorically, the French Charville and British “Brown Bess” Land Pattern muskets were outstandingly successful designs, and both remained in service for over a century with only minor modifications. This standardisation was a major step forward in tactical and, more importantly, logistical terms. Armies could no longer entirely live off the land: ammunition and powder had to be made and sent to the troops. With standard designs, it also became possible to “cannibalise” damaged weapons for spare parts, something that was impossible if weapons were locally bought by individual regiments.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_wine_estates_european	\\n\\nThe entire process is still subject to the vagaries of weather, soil and time. It is quite possible for an estate to produce a truly great wine one year and a foul one the next because, while standards are improving, there are still a great many variables that are only dimly understood. \\n\\nIn some parts of the world, a great wine estate is a prestigious possession, over and above its economic value. \\n\\nAnd the value could be great indeed: the 18th Century was a time of prodigious boozing in Europe. Georgian Englishmen, for example, apparently had bottomless gullets even by contemporary standards, as the available water was not always fit to drink. Contrary to the popular belief of the time, excessive drinking was not the cause of gout (an agonising inflammation of the joints) only a contributory factor. Gout is triggered by a high-protein diet (as favoured by the wealthier classes of the period), and the liberal use of toxic lead compounds to sweeten wine probably did little to help matters!	false

They are denied equipment that other, higher status regular units take for granted. Such a view is wrong. As militia, the Landesschutzen are rather skilful in combat, with good marksmanship skills; they can certainly hold their own against other militia forces, and give careless regular infantry a nasty surprise. As they lack bayonets, they use their rifles as clubs in close combat.\\n\\nIn 1805 Austria lost the Tyrol to Bavaria, thanks to defeat at the hands of the French and their allies. In 1809 Andreas Hofer, an Austrian nationalist, organised a rebellion against his new masters, took the Tyrol back, and succeeded in capturing Innsbruck not once, but twice. Hofer had been a militia captain in the war against the French, and was a sharpshooter of some skill. A thorn in the side of the French generals, he was tricked, captured, tried and executed by firing squad in 1810, ensuring his place as a hero.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_army_staff_college_european	\\n\\nTactics may win battles, but wars are won thanks to information, strategy and, above all, supply. An army that is unfed and lost is no use to anyone. An army staff college produces officers with the skills needed to deal with the many details involved in keeping an army in the field. Apart from an understanding of strategy, officers are taught military illustration (the vital skill of producing accurate sketch maps and diagrams), some surveying, military law, how to behave like a proper gentleman (regrettably necessary in some cases), horsemanship, weapons handling and given character-building instruction. The end product is a man who can be an aide to a general in all situations.\\n\\nHistorically, the British, for example, had an inherent distrust of armies as tools of tyranny, and this may have contributed to the low priority given to raising professional standards. Pupils had to fund their studies from their own pockets at the Royal Military College! This had an additional advantage, of course, in ensuring that only candidates from the “right” social classes could afford to attend.

building_description_texts_long_description_sheep_tenanted_farms_european	\\n\\nTenanted farms primarily produce cash crops. The landlord expects his rent to be paid, so subsistence farming is a waste of time, as it will not generate any income. Successful tenants, who develop the land, can become quietly wealthy men and may be able to buy their farms. \\n\\nFor a landlord the main benefit of tenanted farms is that income from them is in cash, not kind. Absentee landlords can therefore live the high life in a city; they rarely need trouble themselves with the mud and muck of the countryside – as long as they have trustworthy agents and tenants! A leisured class of “gentlemen farmers” and rentiers therefore arises, all thanks to the efforts of tenant farmers.\\n\\nHistorically, tenanted farms made good profit but, like all farming, were subject to the vagaries of the weather. Tenancies could be, and were, passed down the generations of families, something that allow tenants to see a point in developing “their” land with their cash surplus.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sArmy1_cantonment_european	\\n\\nIt is extremely useful for all governments to be able to keep a visible military presence in the country, a reminder that “the rod and the axe” are available, should they be needed. This is true even in countries where liberty and freedom are trumpeted loudly: too much liberty, especially among the lower orders of society, is a dangerous thing. It is equally important to keep soldiers apart from the common folk; disorder and crime nearly always follow when they are allowed to mix.\\n\\nHistorically, most military cantonments or encampments had a distinctly non-military appearance. Most armies had a huge train of sutlers to provide food and drink, wagon masters for transport, armourers and smiths for weapons and gear, pioneers, holy men, hangers-on, hawkers and officers’ servants. Alongside these was another army of wives, children, and the inevitable prostitutes plying their trade to officers and men alike. States recognised that these people were necessary to the smooth running of armies, but that did not mean that they made life easy for them, or looked after them in any way. On campaign, units had an allowance of wives, but those women left behind would have to shift for themselves and hope for a portion of their men’s pay.	false

technologies_long_description_economy3_screw_propeller	\\n\\nUnlike a paddlewheel, a screw propeller is entirely underwater, and is largely invulnerable to enemy fire as a result. However, it does add to the draft of a ship, so a pilot must have his wits about him in shallow water. The mechanism is, however, far more efficient than any combination of paddlewheels (either stern or side), and can drive a ship at much higher speed for a given engine size.\\n\\nHistorically, the screw propeller had its origins in Archimedes’ Screw, an ancient method of lifting water to a higher level. The screw’s potential for propulsion was recognised early on, but not actually implemented. It required steam power, coupled with further refinements to the shape of the screw propeller, to finally see it adopted instead of paddle wheels. British engineer Francis Pettit Smith (1808-1874) accidentally discovered that smaller propellers work better than big ones. During one of his many tests, a piece of his screw propeller snapped off, and he noticed that, rather than grinding to a halt, the ship actually accelerated.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_austria_hofburg	\\n\\nThe Hofburg was the imperial residence of the Hapsburgs in Vienna, with sections dating back to the Middle Ages. The idea of this being a single palace is something of a mistake, as it is a complex of buildings that has grown up over the centuries as the needs (not to mention rivalries and dislikes) of the Hapsburg rulers have changed. It housed chapels, a music school, and numerous smaller residences for cadet branches of the family. Indeed, there is a complete second palace in the Imperial Stables, a result of a falling out between the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I and his son, the Crown Prince Maximilian. Relations between the two were so bad that the Emperor did not want his son under the same roof!\\n\\nOver the centuries the Hofburg has been extensively rebuilt and remodelled as funds have been available and tastes have changed. It remains, however, a serious expression of Imperial power and grandeur. The building is still in use today as the official residence of the Austrian president.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Light_Austrian_Grenzers	\\n\\nThis light infantry unit is used to harass and disrupt the enemy during battle. Like other skirmishers, grenzers consider themselves a cut above most infantrymen. They are expected to show individual aggression, initiative and soldiering skills, not just blindly obey and fight in formation. Their inability to form an effective square formation does leave them vulnerable to cavalry, but their fire accuracy is adequate compensation.\\n\\nHistorically, the Austrians had a tradition of creating high-quality light forces such as hussars and skirmishers. The grenzers were part of this tradition, recruited from among the Croat and Transylvania population of the Austrian Empire’s domains as frontier guards against the Turks. As frontiersmen, they had a certain air of lawlessness and even banditry, but they proved extremely able light troops. Over time, they became a hybrid type between line infantry and skirmishers: often deployed in battle in the line, but with the ability to skirmish when necessary. As an identifiable infantry nomenclature, grenzers remained in Austrian service until the end of the First World War in 1918.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Steam_Ship_38	\\n\\nBy fitting a steam engine and all its machinery into an existing hull, naval architects created a small ship-of-the-line not entirely tied to the wind and tide. The results are moderately successful, as a steamship can sail independently of the wind, but still spend a good deal of time under sail to save fuel. Tactically, however, the steamship has another advantage: manoeuvrability. The 38 guns aboard can be brought to bear with ease.\\n\\nHistorically, steam shipbuilding owes a great debt to the British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a man who built ships, bridges and railways. His first ship, the SS Great Western, made 74 Atlantic crossings during its life. Not content with this, Brunel designed and built an iron, screw-driven “liner”, the SS Great Britain. The first screw-driven ship to cross the Atlantic, she is now splendidly restored and preserved at Bristol Docks in England.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_D_Erlon	\\n\\nD’Erlon is a competent leader, able to inspire battle-weary troops, even in the bleakest of situations. A general who carries the respect of his soldiers is a valuable asset and should be treasured. It is advisable to keep him out of the thick of battle, not just for his protection but also so he can be sent to where he can inspire and rally men for maximum effect.\\n\\nFormer corporal of the French royalist army Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon, was one of Napoleon’s ablest generals, and given command of I Corps during the 100 Days. Having risen from the ranks during the revolution, he proved to be a very able man and fought on virtually every front during the Napoleonic Wars, including in Spain. Unlike the Emperor, he therefore had direct experience of what the British could do in battle. This, however, did not help him during the attack on La Haye Sainte, one of the key moments of Waterloo.\\n\\nD’Erlon survived the final fall of Napoleon, and was eventually rehabilitated and employed by the Bourbon monarchy as Governor of Algeria. Recalled, he was made a Marshal of France and retired before he died, in bed.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tEducation2_university_middle_east	\\n\\nEach turn, there is a chance that the university will produce a scholar of particular note, and the faculty will be of use in researching new technologies. Society does not necessarily want the university to produce radical thinkers, but able, polished men to occupy the high offices of state. Even so, education does tend to produce questioning minds. As Muslims, the students can study not only their faith, but also the law, jurisprudence, science, and history. At the same time, there is also a distinctly Turkish flavour, as Ottoman culture and achievements are celebrated and studied. There is a socially and nationally cohesive view of the world that is not quite the same as a purely Islamic education on offer elsewhere.\\n\\nHistorically, Islamic education was among the best on offer anywhere in the world. Subjects ranged across Arabic literature, English, French, Dutch, and other useful trade languages, as well as science, medicine, mathematics, and world history. The scholars produced were intellectually rounded individuals, with a better formal education than western Europeans.	false

With a powerful charge, they can deal a devastating blow to an enemy line. However, their horses are slow moving and, like all cavalry, vulnerable to infantry in square. As heavy cavalry they are little use chasing down enemies; they are at their best when used to deal a crushing blow to an enemy.\\n\\nHistorically, Spain’s reputation as a European power had suffered greatly under the rule of the Hapsburg family and Charles II. However, King Carlos III instigated a cultural revival, and his reign quickly became known as the “Ilustracion”. The arts, sciences and economy flourished as intellectuals embraced new ideas from all over the globe and travelled Europe to broaden their understanding. The army also saw a marked improvement, thanks to forward-thinking generals, who attempted to emulate the French army, correctly regarded as the best in western Europe.	false

Their overall competence and excellent morale inspire nearby troops to fight all the harder. However, in common with ordinary line regiments, the Coldsteamers are vulnerable to artillery bombardment and skirmishers’ sniping.\\n\\nAt the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, the Coldstream Guards defended Hougoumont. The farm was important for Wellington’s Anglo-Dutch army as it protected his right flank. Despite assault after assault, the Guards and their comrades managed to hold the place against the French.\\n\\nThe Coldstream Guards are still in service today and continue to celebrate their victory with the ceremony of ”Hanging the Brick”. A large stone from Hougoumont is marched through their barracks by the officers while the junior ranks attempt to steal it. Naturally, these utterly solemn proceedings involve wearing fancy dress and quite a lot of drinking!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Steam_Ship_British_Ironclad	\\n\\nAn ironclad is an incredibly tough ship, able to withstand pounding by almost any comparable vessel. A thick outer skin of iron is riveted to a conventional wooden hull, and the two layers can defeat most solid shot except at very close range. Combined with a steamship’s ability to ignore the wind and go where the captain wills, this makes an ironclad a formidable opponent. This power is not without risk, though, as a boiler explosion will rip out the heart of any steamship.\\n\\nHistorically, ironclads first saw action during the American Civil War (1861-65). During the Battle of Hampton Road CSS Virginia made short work of the wooden ships in the river, but an encounter next day with USS Monitor ended inconclusively, as neither ship could knock out the other. These vessels were not, however, the first ironclad warships; they were heavy river gunboats or monitors, and almost incapable of going to sea. The first ocean-going ironclad warships were HMS Warrior and the French Navy’s La Gloire, launched during yet another arms race between Britain and France. Warrior was launched specifically to steal French thunder and make their ship obsolete, being commissioned and built while the French vessel was still on the slipway.	false

Like all Scotsmen, they are sure they are the best soldiers in the world and can fight like the Devil. This may be true, but more disciplined and less impetuous cavalry can beat them.\\n\\nMore properly called the 2nd Royal North British Dragoons, the Scots Greys were one of the oldest dragoon regiments in British service. The term “North Britain” was preferred in official circles to “Scotland” after the Act of Union between England and Scotland, and abortive Jacobite rebellions, but the name Scots Greys was used anyway. Distinguished by their all-grey mounts, the 2nd RNBD achieved immortality as part of the Union Brigade in Uxbridge’s magnificent and successful heavy cavalry charge against the French centre at Waterloo. Sergeant Charles Ewart of the 2nd RNBD captured an Eagle in the action, but the whole of the British heavy cavalry were not kept in-hand, and were “blown” for the rest of the battle. Lady Elizabeth Butler’s painting “Scotland Forever” depicts their charge in all its glory, and remains one of the finest examples of patriotic art ever created.	false

Without the trees the soil is soon gone, washed away in the first strong rains. It then becomes almost impossible for any kind of trees to re-establish themselves. This worried hardly anyone at the end of the 18th Century, although there were honourable exceptions: some men did go out of their way to plant trees so that navies would never be without supplies. The world had been given to men by God for them to subdue, and there were always more trees in the next valley, and the next.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_French_Grenadiers_a_Cheval	\\n\\nGrenadiers à Cheval ride the largest and strongest steeds. Although relatively slow, their charge into an enemy is almost certain to do terrible damage. Once in close combat, the grenadiers are strong enough to continue the slaughter. They may meet their match charging against infantry in square, or in a fight with well-disciplined elite infantry but, even then, they embrace death with the same resolve they display in attack.\\n\\nTo modern eyes, the concept of a mounted grenadier looks more than a little odd: surely the horses would panic at the first grenade explosion? Like all other grenadiers, the Grenadiers à Cheval were large men, chosen for their physical qualities. To be admitted to the grenadiers, a man had to been cited for bravery, have several campaigns under his belt, and be a strapping fellow. Mounted on large black horses, and resplendent in their bearskins, they made for an intimidating presence and were nicknamed ‘The Giants’ or ‘The Gods’ by their fellow Frenchmen.	false

Any attacker attempting to breach the defences must be prepared for a long siege, followed by a bloody and dangerous assault.\\n\\nHistorically, some of the most impressive fortifications ever constructed were the product of the Ottoman and Mughal empires.

building_description_texts_long_description_opera_house_tribal	\\n\\nA wide variety of burial customs are observed. Some believe that the air is important to the passing of their loved ones. Thus wooden scaffolds are created and the dead placed on top, so their spirit may pass into the wind. Others believe the spirit must be kept with the body after death and thus build ‘spirit houses’ to trap the spirit. These little wooden structures can take many forms, some even look like miniature houses standing over the body.\\n\\nBurial rites are often closely tied to tribal totems: eagle-related tribes, for example,  always place their dead on scaffolding. A bear totem tribe often buries the dead in wooded areas, and so on.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_usa_smithsonian	\\n\\nThe Smithsonian is not like other major museums, established to show off the collections of wealthy patrons or as an exercise in national glory. Instead, it is the legacy of a man who was neither an American nor visited the country. James Smithson (1765–1829) stipulated that his fortune was to be used for the “increase & diffusion of Knowledge among men” if his nephew died without leaving an heir. With over pre-inflationary $500,000 in the fund, it took Congress nearly a decade to decide how to spend the money and the Smithsonian “Castle” in Washington was only completed in 1855.\\n\\nSince then, the Smithsonian has become one of the world’s leading repositories for historical objects and archives, funded by the US government and private donations. It now has 20 different branches, specialising in everything from ethnic art and objects to aerospace exhibits, and helping to manage the Smithsonian is one of the (very few) official duties of the Vice President of the United States.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_French_Chasseurs_a_Cheval	\\n\\nThese light cavalrymen do not hold with armour, even the sensible steel skull caps many other units favour beneath their officially-sanctioned hats and caps. Chasseurs à Cheval carry swords, carbines and pistols, but they are not expected to charge home, merely harass and pursue enemies. This makes them effective against skirmishers and artillery. Their horses have good endurance, are fast and properly looked after: a cavalryman without his horse is useless. They are vulnerable when matched against heavier cavalry and well-trained infantry in square.\\n\\nHistorically, the Chasseurs à Cheval were given the impressive nickname of ‘Invincibles’ by Napoleon. The men of this regiment were veterans from the Guides à Cheval, a regiment created to guard Napoleon’s headquarters when he was on campaign in Italy. The Chasseurs went on to act as a personal escort to Napoleon, following him everywhere. So deep was Napoleon’s respect for this unit and its men that he regularly chose to appear in public sporting their green undress uniform. This affectation also suited his sense of theatre and emphasised his common touch with the ordinary soldiers.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tSecret1_gentlemens_club_european	\\n\\nA member's club is a sanctuary, a place to escape everyday life and spend some time with like-minded fellows. They are also quiet, private places, where secrets can be shared and deals done out of sight of others. They are, in fact, breeding grounds for intrigue, gossip, and double-dealing, making them the perfect breeding ground for unsavoury spies.\\n\\nHistorically, member's clubs first appeared in London towards the end of the 18th century. They were highly exclusive in their early years and provided the upper classes with somewhere to gamble, technically an illegal pastime. However, gambling was the least of many evils practised in these clubs. Perhaps the most infamous of these societies was the Hellfire Club, originally established in London in 1719 by the Duke of Wharton, simply for the purposes of debauchery. In 1735, the Irish Hellfire Club was established, and went on to outdo its predecessor in as many foul ways as possible. These included paying defrocked priests to perform mock Catholic masses, sacrificing cats to Satan and, allegedly, on one occasion offering up a dwarf in a diabolic sacrifice. To this day, no one is entirely sure why a dwarf was considered appropriate.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Trade_Ship_Indiaman	\\n\\nUnusually for a merchant ship, an Indiaman carries cargo, passengers, and a good number of guns. Intended to sail from Europe to the other side of the world and back carrying valuable, even priceless, cargoes, these ships have to be able to defend themselves. The Indiaman’s 9- and 18-pounders are sufficient to fight off smaller attackers, but it is vulnerable to boarding. Carrying a cargo does not help its speed either, and the added guns mean the upkeep has an impact on any profit made. However, a defendable trade ship is always more profitable than stolen goods or kidnapped passengers.\\n\\nHistorically, East Indiamen resembled ships of the line, both in their general configuration and paintwork. At the Battle of Pulo Aura (1804), the ambiguous appearance and aggressive handling of a squadron of British Indiamen completely humbugged the French admiral, Charles-Alexandre Linois. He withdrew in the face of “superior” forces. Commodore Nathaniel Dance, of the British Company fleet, received a knighthood and a handsome reward for his cunning.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_Early_Napoleon	\\n\\nNapoleon’s presence alone is enough to inspire battle weary troops to fight on, even in the bleakest of situations. He commands the respect and adoration of his troops, and respects and cares for them in return. The moral fibre he instils in lesser men is a valuable asset on the battlefield. It is advisable to keep him away from the thick of the fighting: it is his task to have a cool head, not be pre-occupied with swinging a sword.\\n\\nFrom an early age Napoleon’s school masters commented on his pride and ambition, aspects of his personality that were to follow him through to adulthood. Many of his teachers took the time to nurture this talented and promising young man, but none more so than Baron du Teil, the commandant of the artillery school Napoleon attended. He helped lay the foundations for Napoleon’s skills with artillery and helped him to develop a better understanding of tactical concepts which he would later use to outstanding effect. Even as a mature commander, Napoleon never lost his grasp of the simple truth that artillery won battles for him.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_vineyards_european	\\n\\nWine is one of the pleasures of life for all classes in society and, along with ale, is the standard drink of many Europeans thanks to poor quality water supplies in towns and cities. No one actually cares about the public health implications of wells and open sewers in close proximity to each other!\\n\\nThe patterns of growth and consumption of wine in the 18th Century often had some odd roots. The British taste for “claret” (Bordeaux wine) dates back to the Middle Ages when the English monarchy controlled the region. Much of the earliest “New World” wine is supposedly the result of plantings by the Catholic Church to ensure that they had a supply of wine for Mass. Grape varieties can have similar odd origins: Shiraz, for example, started as Syrah grapes, originating in Persia and were brought back to France around the time of the Crusades. There were many more local grape varieties than today, because pests from America wiped out older types in the 19th Century.	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Guerrilla_Fusiliers	\\n\\nRecruited from vengeful and patriotic Spaniards outraged by the French usurpation of their lands, Guerrilla Fusiliers are mountain men who have grown up using firearms, swords and knives. This personal experience makes them individually skilled and they are effective in melee as a result. They are at a disadvantage when facing enemies such artillery and skirmishers, but they have enough tactical sense to be able to form square when threatened by cavalry.\\n\\nDuring the French occupation of Spain, the French army committed many crimes against the Spanish people, often with the connivance of their officers. Theft, rape and murder were commonplace, and seen as practical ways to strike back at the “brigands” and “bandits” of the guerrilla, or little war. Friends and family would suffer, even if the fighters did not. In their turn, the Spanish treated any Frenchmen they caught with similar brutality. Family honour, a driving force for many Spaniards, meant that they had to avenge their dead no matter what the personal cost. So while the government apparently did little, the people made the lives of the French invaders a hell of ambushes and fear. The French army was almost paralysed at times by the need to protect its rear and supply lines from the guerrillas.	false

The local population has little loyalty to their occupiers, however, and we stand to benefit greatly by liberating these steadfast people from oppression; requisitioning their resources for the greater good of the Empire!	false

technologies_long_description_admin5_passports	\\n\\nThose without the correct documentation cannot proceed on their way, and governments are not above changing the required documents without notice as a way of controlling their people. Passports and adequate record keeping also allow governments to monitor exactly how many suspicious foreigners may be lurking on their soil at any one time. Such knowledge can be of great use in making life much harder for spies and foreign provocateurs to carry out their foul and nefarious schemes of sabotage and spreading discontent!\\n\\nA “pass port” was the right to enter or leave by a gate. The invention of the modern idea of a passport is credited to the English king Henry V (1386–1422) and was called a “safe conduct”. This guaranteed that the person carrying it could travel safely to and in foreign lands. Passports have since changed to become a proof of identity and a guarantee that a person will be aided and defended from threats to his well being by his country. Many embassies spend much of their time and resources helping citizens in distress in foreign parts, and the guarantee of support to a passport holder continues to include the use of military force.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_Hussars	\\n\\nThese superb horsemen can be used as a screen for the main army, or for strategic scouting to locate the enemy. Hussar speed makes them ideal for targeting skirmishers and artillery: enemies have little chance to escape if hussars are sent against them. Hussars are armed with curved sabres, and can acquit themselves well in melee or during a charge, although they do not fare well against disciplined infantry or heavy cavalry.\\n\\nHistorically, hussars of all nations enjoyed the freebooting attitude of the Hungarian originals, and acted independently of the main army as much as they could. This was useful, because they could be sent out to do long patrols or reconnaissance, and possibly a little plundering. Their high-spirited approach to war was matched by their popinjay uniforms, some of the gaudiest ever to have been worn into battle. Hussar arrogance, however, was well deserved: in 1806 some 500 French hussars bluffed a 6,000-strong Prussian garrison at Stettin into surrendering the fortress there.	false

The ability to sail directly into the wind is something that no sail-powered vessel can ever match.\\n\\nThe idea of going into battle with a fire raging in his ship’s belly was not one that appeals to every captain. Fire was always a risk aboard a wooden vessel, and boiler explosions were not unknown. There was also the problem of coaling stations: while these ships carried sails, they did need regular supplies of coal. Steam was a tactical advantage, not a strategic one.\\n\\nHistorically, the first British ship to be designed and built from scratch to use steam was HMS Agamemnon, laid down in 1852; previous steam warships were conversions from sailing ships-of-the-line. Agamemnon was fitted with sails and carried 91 guns. She also had a short career as the Navy’s pride and joy, as she was paid off in 1862.

building_description_texts_long_description_modern_university_european	\\n\\nThe investigation of the universe, and disputation over the results, are not done out of any sense of altruism, of course. National pride in intellectual achievement is an important motive in the work undertaken. Personal pride and ambition are also stern taskmasters. But what is significant is that the ideas, theories and facts generated at the university are not kept within the academic elite. This flowering of learning informs and inspires artists, poets and musicians, and well-read laymen too. The practical benefits of the advances made here percolate out into the wider national society, improving life for the ordinary people in ways both small and dramatic.\\n\\nIn the 18th Century great universities and the great minds they attracted were sources of nationalistic pride. Sir Isaac Newton was lauded across Europe for his work at Cambridge in England. The University of Gottingen aided the development of “German-ness” by publishing research and standard texts in German as well as Latin (the traditional language of learning). Gottingen was also unusual in, rather daringly, letting lecturers teach any book without reference to the State or Church!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_britain_somerset_house	\\n\\nBuilt on the Strand, Somerset House was in a neo-classical style, and was not unusual in having its own water gates and docks in the basement. Eighteenth Century roads were fairly appalling, so the River Thames was the main highway through London and well frequented by government officials. The Thames was also the main sewer for London, which may have made it difficult for casual onlookers to distinguish between politicians and lumps of dung.\\n\\nWhen Somerset House was designed, it was intended to be a home for most of the government, at least according to the Act of Parliament in 1775 that enabled the work. Among other departments, space was to be available for the Salt Office, the Stamp Office, the Tax Office, the Navy Office (later the Admiralty), the Navy Victualling Office, the Publick Lottery Office, the Hawkers and Pedlar Office, the Hackney Coach Office, the Surveyor General of the Crown Lands Office, the Auditors of the Imprest Office, the Pipe Office, the Offices of the Duchies of Lancaster and of Cornwall, the Office of the Ordinance, the Bargemaster’s House, and the King’s Barge Houses. Over the next decades, additional building work allowed the Royal Academy, the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquities to find rooms, not to mention the University of London as some government tenants either moved out or were closed down.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_university_european	\\n\\nEducation is vital for those who wish to enter the professions, or make their way in government using talent alone. A good, well-trained brain is an excellent substitute for birth and social connections. A young gentleman’s studies can be wide ranging, and need not be tied to any particular faculty or subject area – an awarded degree or doctorate is proof enough of intellectual achievement.\\n\\nHistorically, in Europe at least, the established church controlled most universities, either through paying for them or by laws requiring the tutors to take holy orders. Sir Isaac Newton was very unusual in that he didn’t take orders when he was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge (a post currently held by Stephen Hawking), arguing that the post required the holder to spend time on science, not the Anglican Church. However, the requirement for teachers to accept Church doctrine did mean that universities had a socially conservative outlook. While scholarships were available, students had to have money to attend, reinforcing this conservatism. While wild, threatening ideas about the world and the way it worked did emerge from universities, the institutions were rarely radical or revolutionary breeding grounds.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Small_Sloop	\\n\\nSpeed is the sloop’s weapon: a ketch-rigged sloop is capable of sailing very close to the wind, far closer indeed than many larger ships. This ability allows it to stay out of trouble, most of the time, if under a competent master. This is fortunate, as a sloop does not have the weight of shot, being armed with relatively light six-pounder cannon; or structural strength to last very long against a real battleship.\\n\\nA sloop was hardly ever the command of a post-captain, a man who was on the permanent list of naval officers. The commanding officer of a sloop was called “captain”, at least to his face, but his official title was usually “master and commander”; his rank, and pay, was that of lowly lieutenant. Commander as a naval rank, as opposed to job title, was a later development. This is why, somewhat confusingly to civilians, a naval commander is outranked by a naval captain, and it is still something that baffles Hollywood scriptwriters from time to time. Command of a sloop, however, was a chance for a young officer to get away from stuffy superiors and to shine in his own right as an aggressive and successful leader.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_settlement_fortifications_improved	\\n\\nExtensive fortifications cost huge sums of money and much effort. There is little point in constructing them unless they are maintained and needed for the future survival and prosperity of a town. A defensive wall is good for a sense of security, but it does not feed a hungry family after a poor local harvest! As a practical matter, then, these fortifications are erected along borders and around towns of real strategic significance.\\n\\nThe defences are laid out according to the latest military fashions, and as well built as any purely military fortifications. This can cause local problems, as prime building land is either used for the forts themselves, or must be kept clear to provide excellent fields of fire. During long periods of peace, the city fathers must resist the temptation to cover the killing zones with houses and commercial properties!\\n\\nHistorically, fortresses created by Marshal Vauban of France dominated their towns for centuries. The defences of Strasbourg, in Alsace, are typical of his work, and were a clear geographical boundary until the end of the 19th Century.	false

There are few soldiers that can withstand their terrifying charge, making them excellent shock troops. As is often the case, their courage and eagerness to enter battle betrays a certain wildness; their undisciplined nature can find them plunging blindly into trouble, making them particularly vulnerable in melee.\\n\\nHistorically, Russians and other Eastern Europeans had an ambiguous relationship with the Cossacks. There was admiration for their warrior culture and freewheeling ways, yet a certain wariness of their wild nature. They lacked the discipline of other troops and had a certain fondness for drink, but it was their constant harassment that helped destroy Napoleon’s Grand Armée. Their reputation inspired fear in their enemies and won many a fight even before the Cossacks voiced their deafening war cries.	false

technologies_long_description_military1_diamond_formation	\\n\\nA diamond formation, as the name suggests, is a way of employing all the men of a cavalry unit to best effect. Rather than being arranged as a simple wedge, point towards the enemy, the unit tapers off from its broadest point. Even though the riders may be knee-to-knee to maximise the shock of impact should a charge connect with a target, a diamond-formed unit can change direction quickly. This is not true with the earlier cavalry wedge, the members of which find any kind of wheeling turn difficult to execute.\\n\\nHistorically, the Swedes were among the leaders in European cavalry tactics at the start of the 18th Century; King Charles XII was all in favour of closely packed, large cavalry formations as he believed that these could break the enemy by fear alone. There was debate among military men in other nations too: in Britain the Duke of Marlborough favoured his cavalry charging home with cold steel, rather than relying on fear or bullets to do their terrible work.	false

events_event_text_rum_rebellion	An armed insurrection has taken place in New South Wales, Australia, and the New South Wales Corp have deposed the governor – one William Bligh. Bligh is well-known as a harsh and uncompromising disciplinarian who always carries out his duty to the letter, and this is the second time a mutiny has taken place in response to aspects of his command.\\n\\nFollowing typically draconian moves to prevent circumvention of the laws surrounding the manufacture and distribution of alcohol to the Corps, Bligh found himself arrested at home by the Corps led by Captain Johnson. Once the acting governor, Joseph Foveaux, arrived he sent Johnson and his associates for courts-martial, and Bligh was given command of a ship and ordered to return to England to give account of his actions. Instead choosing to sail to Tasmania to raise support for an armed coup to recapture the colony; Bligh was surprised that the governor of Tasmania did not support him, and he was confined to his ship until it was recalled to England.\\n\\nFor his part in the rebellion Johnson was eventually cashiered – a lenient penalty under the circumstances, but reflecting the bloodless nature of events. Bligh was criticised for his handling of the affair, yet promoted to Rear Admiral. It is interesting to note that, since the affair occurred, the British authorities have given the governorship of the colonies exclusively to army officers instead of those from the Royal Navy.	false

If the resistance is to be defeated utterly we must work to undermine it where it is strongest - in the hearts and minds of the ordinary people. The people of Catalonia have been especially persistent in their resistance to our rule; the cultural and political significance of this region, as well as its proximity to our borders, makes bringing its people under control a matter of the utmost importance.\\n\\nTo this end, I propose sending provocateurs to Barcelona in order to convert the people to the Emperor's philosophy of an enlightened peace. Tax exemption may seem like the simplest solution, but I advise against this course of action; while the populace will be temporarily placated, the region will cease contributing to our war funds.	false

The roadbed itself drains well, and can support large volumes of traffic and individually heavy items such as cannons.\\n\\nHistorically, the most famous and effective land route in world was probably the collection of toll roads and turnpikes known as the “Grand Trunk” in India. Much of it was little more than compacted dirt (mud in the rainy season) but large parts were well constructed. Trade, the lifeblood of the continent, and many armies, passed up and down the Grand Trunk over the centuries, from the wilds of the mountainous borders with Afghanistan to the rich provinces of the South. The Grand Trunk was also the murderous hunting ground of members of the Thuggee cult. These followers of the Hindu goddess Kali would befriend unsuspecting travellers, put them at their ease and then murder and rob them as an act of sacrament. Oddly, not all Thugs were Hindu; Muslims and Sikhs were found in their ranks, probably for the loot.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_French_Guard_Chasseurs_a_Cheval	\\n\\nThese light cavalrymen carry swords and carbines, but they are not expected to charge home, instead they are a superb force to disrupt enemy plans and pursue the routing foes. They are, for example, incredibly effective against skirmishers and artillery. Their horses have good endurance and are fast: a cavalryman without his horse is, after all, fairly useless. They are vulnerable when facing heavier cavalry and well-trained infantry in square, but they can fire their carbines when mounted.\\n\\nThe Guard Chasseurs à Cheval, Napoleon’s closest guards, had their origins on the battlefields of northern Italy and the “Guides” that Napoleon raised there. When the regiment was officially constituted in 1800 it had four officers and 113 men, all chosen from among the Guides and other veterans of the Italian campaign. Napoleon’s respect for his regiment was obvious and he was often seen wearing the green undress uniform of the chasseurs. These men followed Napoleon from Arcola to Waterloo, and remained loyal to him even in his exile. Few Chasseurs consented to serve under the restored Bourbons when the Emperor finally abdicated.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Elite_French_Old_Guard	\\n\\nThese highly trained and experienced troops are handpicked by Napoleon and act as part of his personal guard. Taken from the ranks of the Imperial Guard, the Old Guard is made up of the most intimidating soldiers the French army has to offer. Chosen specifically for their physical attributes and notably above average height, these men strike fear into the hearts of Napoleon’s enemies. Their prowess as soldiers is world-renowned and the mere presence of these men on the battlefield can inspire even war weary fellow Frenchmen to fight on.\\n\\nAfter his dramatic defeat in Russia, Napoleon bid farewell to the Old Guard. These men were his few remaining loyal soldiers but, with no support in Paris, Napoleon was forced to disband them. However, following Napoleon’s return from exile in 1815, they were recalled and marched triumphantly back to Paris with their leader. The end of the Old Guard came at the Battle of Waterloo where they were routed for the first and only time. For many of the French soldiers fighting that day, the retreat of the Old Guard was the end of the battle and the end of Napoleon himself.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_pSupplySpain3_military_port_complex	\\n\\nThe port is a place of bustle, business and excitement. Goods and military supplies are likely to be stacked in apparently random profusion, while clerks and shipping agents argue about manifests, shipping prices and delivery details. The apparent disorder is, however, deceptive, for everyone knows exactly where everything is and where everything should be going. Shipping goods and supplies by sea is well understood, but carrying them on roads is a slow and painful affair, thanks to the poor quality of many roads.\\n\\nBy the Napoleonic times, navies were well practiced in running shore establishments. The division between commercial and military ports was there, but not considered important when getting supplies shipped across the sea. What mattered more to the port authorities was the “shrinkage” of goods disappearing as dock workers helped themselves, and the need to keep rough booze and cheap floozies away from ship’s crews for as long as possible. A port admiral would spend a good deal of effort on what might be termed public order every time a fleet arrived and needed unloading!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Italian_Guards_of_Honour	\\n\\nThese men make excellent melee troops, riding hard into battle with their sabres drawn. Their only weakness is when facing well-disciplined elite infantry in square formation; this combination is one that proves deadly to slow heavy cavalry. Guards of Honour sacrifice speed for power, and are not expected to chase down an enemy. They are a brute force, a fist to smash against an enemy line, used to deal the blow that drives an enemy from the battlefield.\\n\\nFollowing his disastrous campaign in Russia, Napoleon returned home and set about rebuilding his Grande Armée. Cavalry units were incredibly expensive to recruit, yet Napoleon managed to recruit 10,000 elite horsemen at no expense to France’s budget. He recruited new cavalry units from the nobles and bourgeois, who were expected to provide their own horses, equipment and uniform. In return they would be assured the rank of sous-lieutenant, providing they completed 12 months service. This qualifier was to prove extremely important, as desertion was rife amongst these pampered children of the upper classes.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rIron2_steam-pumped_iron_mine_european	\\n\\nAs soon as a mine shaft drops below the water table, flooding is a constant danger to life and profits. Pumping or lifting the water allows the miners to reach richer, deeper mineral seams. A stationary steam beam engine can lift enough water to make it economically sensible to dig deep shafts. The greater availability of iron also makes the recruitment of all land units significantly cheaper. However these new inventions are not welcome among the lower classes. They quite rightly fear being replaced with machines, and are unhappy as a result.\\n\\nHistorically, Thomas Newcomen was the first to develop a practical “atmospheric” engine for draining deep mines sometime around 1710. His design had some problems and was inefficient, but it worked well enough to be widely adopted where coal was easy to obtain. James Watt’s beam engine design was altogether more efficient, and it formed the basis of all steam engines built afterwards. He was also lucky in his choice of working partner: Matthew Boulton proved to be an astute business manager and lobbyist. Boulton even persuaded the British Parliament to extend the steam engine patent, guaranteeing the pair further profit!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Dragoons	\\n\\nThe Dragoons’ strength lies in their versatility: on horseback they can produce an impressive charge or they can ride to critical spots on a battlefield where firepower is needed. Once dismounted, they can engage in melee or use their muzzle-loading muskets to fire upon the enemy. This flexibility is also their greatest weakness: they are the slowest of all cavalry units and may have difficulty when facing heavier cavalry and elite infantry.\\n\\nHistorically, the first dragoons were infantrymen, trained to ride into battle but fight on foot. Equipping cavalry units with horses was an expensive business, and so the best were always kept for the ‘real’ cavalry, leaving the dragoons to make do with cheaper, slower steeds. Dragoons slowly changed into cavalry soldiers like any other, and stopped fighting as mounted infantry, although regiments did retain the dragoon title. The “old” cavalry had always regarded them as social inferiors, and the infantry had resented them for not being proper soldiers, so the dragoons welcomed their new acceptability as full-blown cavalry.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_wooden_fort_european	\\n\\nAs a defensive work, it is well able to withstand enemy attacks when properly defended by stalwart men; a garrison should expect to hold out against attacks for some little time. The walls are high enough to give a good firing position to any defenders, and any aggressor had better bring a ladder or particularly acrobatic attackers to a siege! The walls are only the most visible part of the defence: the surrounding trees and undergrowth are cut back to provide a clear firing – and therefore killing – ground for the defenders. This cleared ground often extends well beyond musket range, to deny attackers the chance to approach unseen.\\n\\nUnlike a stockade, a fort is a relative permanent structure and, as such, it serves to mark ownership of territory as much as to command the surrounding area. Forts are positioned with an eye to using the existing terrain, commanding any strategic approaches (such as passes and river crossings) and intimidating the natives.	false

technologies_long_description_admin4_repressive_measures	\\n\\nInstituting repression as an official policy will make a people behave acceptably, as judged by their governors, for as long as they are suitably fearful. By making sure that official revenge for any act of minor rebellion is disproportionate and harsh, major insurrections can be stopped before they begin. Rebellion is expensive to put down, and repairs afterwards are also expensive, so a fearful population is a relatively small price to pay for law and order.\\n\\nHistorically, the “Dos de Mayo”, May 2nd, uprising in 1808 provoked a bloody French backlash, and drove many Spaniards into the arms of the rebels. Once the French commander, General Murat, had Madrid under control he established a military commission under General Grouchy to punish the rebels. The commission sentenced to death anyone arrested with a weapon during the uprising. All were shot, and all Spaniards were ordered to hand over any remaining weaponry. The French hoped that this draconian act would make it clear that rebellion did not pay. The Spaniards took from the events a different message: that the French had to be opposed and driven out of Spain. Murat and Grouchy were not censured by Napoleon for their actions.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Frigate_Carronade_Frigate	\\n\\nNormally frigates would be armed with long guns, probably no larger than 12-pounders. A few short-barrelled 64-pounder carronades might be aboard to give a close-in broadside more weight of shot. A carronade frigate goes one better, and carries nothing but carronades – short guns that are half the weight of the equivalent conventional cannon. While the weight of a broadside is truly awesome, the frigate has to get in close in order to blow an enemy to smithereens thanks to the carronades’ limited range. A clever enemy will stay out of range of the carronades’ horrendous power and take long range pot shots.\\n\\nHistorically, only the Royal Navy experimented with an all-carronade armament aboard HMS Glatton (in service from 1795). Glatton carried 28 64-pounder and 28 32-pounder carronades, giving a weight of fire that was more than 17% greater than HMS Victory could deliver at the Battle of Trafalgar! This massive firepower allowed her, on one occasion, to chase all eight vessels in a French squadron back into port. Oddly enough, the next two vessels to carry the name “Glatton” in RN service were also massively over-armed.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Guerrilla_Tiradores	\\n\\nLargely recruited from among hunters and farmers living in the Spanish mountains, these men have grown up using firearms, and they are crack shots. Their hunting and tracking experience allows them to hide and their loose formation helps to protect them from bombardment. These sharpshooters are best employed sniping enemies from a distance: they will take heavy losses in close-combat, have precious little defence against cavalry, and will they suffer in a formal exchange of volleys with against other infantry.\\n\\nGuerrilla bands were created by the Spanish to fight back against occupying French forces during the Peninsular War. Often outnumbered and outgunned, the guerrillas relied heavily on skirmishing, ambushing and superior knowledge of the landscape to obtain a tactical advantage. Francisco Espoz y Mina (1781-1836) made himself into an expert on guerrilla tactics. He started his career in the “Tiradores de Doyle”, a guerrilla band put together by British officer, Col. Charles W. Doyle, and then went on to be one of the most feared fighting men in Spain.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Guerrilla_Cazadores	\\n\\nIt is the job of these men to cover the main battle line, harass the enemy and, if possible, pick off important enemy leaders. Their range and accuracy are excellent but their inability to form square leaves them vulnerable to cavalry, and a well trained infantry unit will best them in line. However, Guerrilla Cazadores are capable of forming a disciplined line as well as fighting in loose skirmish order.\\n\\nAlthough the romantic image of the guerrilla is of a wild man of the mountains, hiding amongst rocks and sleeping under the stars, some were simply professionals who took up arms to protect their fellow countrymen. Juan Palarea Blanes or El Medico, "The Doctor”, had a successful medical practice in Madrid, at least until the French occupation in 1808. His treatment at French hands forced him to raise a band of guerrillas, originally mainly mounted troops that thwarted the French at every opportunity. In May of 1811 he added the Cazadores Francos Numantinos to his party. These light troops were soon incorporated into the 4th Spanish Army and El Medico and his men gained a reputation for bravery as they fought for the people of Spain.	false

This is also the ideal delivery point for people bringing important and secret information from foreign lands.\\n\\nHistorically, much foreign intelligence gathering in the Napoleon period was hampered by the refusal of gentlemen to “read other people’s mail”. The Ottoman Empire was much more sensible, and the Yildiz Yeskilati may be the very first formal secret service. Other states had ad hoc arrangements, and certainly intercepted diplomatic messages whenever possible. The term “secret service” has meant many different things over the centuries: the US Secret Service, for example, was given the tightly defined job of fighting dollar counterfeiting and, eventually, the protection of the President. Despite the name, the US Secret Service were not spies!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rGold2_steam-pumped_gold_mine_european	\\n\\nA steam beam engine, linked to a pump, can lift enough water in a short time to keep a mine open, and make it sensible to dig deep shafts. Older workings can be kept going even after shallow gold deposits have been plundered. Who is to say how much more money can be made, deep beneath the ground? A steam-pumped gold mine makes an impressive contribution to the mining wealth of its region, and improves the town wealth too. However, even by the standards of the time, conditions for the workers are unpleasant and this makes the lower classes unhappy.\\n\\nBy the time of the Napoleonic Wars, beam engines were over 80 years old, and the engineering behind them was well understood. Cornishman Thomas Newcomen’s original “atmospheric” engine, first used in tin mines, had been made obsolete by newer condensing steam engines. Designs pioneered by James Watt, efficient as they were, did not always persuade mine owners to spend money on replacing old machinery when it was still profitable!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rFarm2_clearances_european	\\n\\nTenanted farms can only generate so much income from rents. With an increase in town size, and an increased demand from industry for agricultural products, it is more profitable to have herds of animals, not a gaggle of tenants. Clearances add to the agricultural wealth of a region, as demand for meat and wool increases rapidly. Apart from any other considerations, moving people off land also creates large areas where landowners can indulge a passion for hunting.\\n\\nThe “Highland Clearances” are probably the most famous example of a forced change to land usage on a large scale. Despite popular legend, it was Highland clan leaders who carried out most of the Scottish clearances, driving their own kinsmen and clansmen into exile. The chieftains wanted to pay for the sophisticated life that they could have in Edinburgh and London by reinventing themselves as Scottish gentry. Sheep simply earned more money than the crofters did.	false

start_pos_factions_description_157607882	Napoleon Bonaparte and his Armée d'Orient are faced with a difficult task: the conquest of Egypt and a march to India. Once in India, they will join forces with Tippu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore, and drive the hated English into the sea! Such is the grandeur of the scheme and, in General Napoleon Bonaparte, there is a commander of equal grandeur to undertake it.\\n\\nBefore this can be achieved, however, there are more immediate obstacles. Egypt is ruled by the Mamelukes, who are nominally loyal servants of the Ottoman Empire. In the burning heat of the desert, Frenchmen must march on Alexandria and break their power before anything else can be achieved. But here, in this land of ancient secrets, there is glory to be won!\\n\\nGlory enough for France, and glory enough, possibly, for General Bonaparte!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_pTrade1_trading_port_european	\\n\\nMost roads are simply terrible, and bulky cargoes must go by ship: it is the only way of moving goods cheaply and relatively quickly. Trading ports improve a country's export capacity and increase trade value. They also make the whole world a marketplace, by allowing sea trade routes to be established.\\n\\nSometimes, the customers are not sure what to make of the goods they are being sent: British merchants insisted on exporting heavy woollen cloth to India for years, even though there was no market for it! Coastal trade was also an easy way to turn a profit in Britain, the leading trade nation. A “cheese fleet” did nothing but sail back and forth between London and the northwest of England, bringing Cheshire cheeses to the London market. By a happy accident of geology, Cheshire had rock salt mines that provided the preservative needed for the local cheese to make the sea journey to London. Although salty, this was undoubtedly healthier than most food on a gentleman’s table!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sArmy5_staff_college_european	\\n\\nTactics win battles, but running an army requires far more from the officers in charge. It is not enough to get men to a battlefield: they must be armed, supplied, fed, shod, and trained before any general can turn them into a victorious tool of the state.\\n\\nIn practice, this meant that officers were taught a wide range of skills, beyond being able to organise a regiment. Apart from an understanding of strategy, officers were taught military illustration, a vital skill of producing accurate sketch maps and diagrams, some surveying, military law, horsemanship, weapons handling, and given character-building instruction. This last item included instruction, when regrettably necessary, in how to behave like a proper gentleman. In many countries, students were expected to pay their own fees, partly to ensure that only the best families sent their sons to the colleges. By all accounts, Napoleon Bonaparte did not listen to many lessons in being a gentleman, or chose to behave like a parvenu boor on occasion in order to annoy as many stuck-up dignitaries as possible!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Lancer_Lancers	\\n\\nThe lance is probably among the oldest of cavalry weapons. It gives the user a chance to put all his weight and that of his charging horse into one very sharp point. A lance that can, in skilled hands, be driven right through any enemy. When coupled with the fast pace of their horses, a lancer’s charge is very intimidating. However, if the lancer does not kill his target, he leaves himself vulnerable. A long lance is less use in a melee than a sword, and a lancer is at a disadvantage once the close fighting starts, especially against well-trained infantry capable of forming square.\\n\\nHistorically, many nations used lancers. The French army adopted lancers with some enthusiasm, and Napoleon even included Polish lancers in his Imperial Guard. In India the lance had long been used as a weapon: lancer skills were often practiced by “pegging”, picking tent pegs out of the ground with the lance tip, or “pig-sticking”, the hunting of wild pigs or even wild dogs with the lance.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Elite_French_Young_Guard	\\n\\nRaised from the ranks of the Imperial Guard, the Young Guard contains the crème de la crème of the new recruits. They inspire surrounding units, encouraging them to fight on in the hope of one day joining the Guard themselves. Unfailing discipline means these men have excellent accuracy and their reload times are exceptionally good. These skills make them an expensive unit. Their only real vulnerabilities are artillery fire and sniping from skirmishers.\\n\\nHistorically, the Young Guard attracted a number of ambitious young soldiers looking to make a name in battle. One such gentleman was Adolphe Edouard Casimir Joseph Mortier, who joined the army in 1791 as a sub-lieutenant. He took part in a number of key battles during the Revolutionary War, leading Napoleon to place his name high on his first list of Marshals in 1804. Mortier was a huge man, greatly respected by his troops, a fact that proved vital during battles in the Peninsular War, but helped him little at Waterloo when he was unable to join the battle due to severe sciatica. He eventually met his end in 1835 when he and eleven other men were killed by a bomb that was intended for the restored King Louis-Philippe.	false

start_pos_factions_description_983852076	Great Britain is a constitutional monarchy, a nation of free trade and personal liberty. Its people are seemingly devoted to making money and disliking foreigners in equal measure. Foreigners are, quite simply, just very good at anything, be that running an empire or making a decent pie. Britons make no secret of their prejudice, a crass attitude that makes diplomacy difficult. The “English” as, much to the annoyance of the Scots, everyone calls them, are disliked in every court in Europe for this arrogance and their willingness to let everyone else do all the fighting and dying against the French. The apparent truth of this last point has been a gift to Bonaparte.\\n\\nIf the British do have a truly visceral dislike, then it would be the French, thanks to traditional rivalry and a genuine horror at the consequences of the French Revolution. While many British politicians were pleased to see an end to the Bourbon monarchy, they were repulsed by the insatiable bloodshed of the Terror, and fearful that the infection of revolution might cross the English Channel, with or without French bayonets to help it along. Invasion is a constant fear and, as always, an enemy in control of the Low Countries is enough to scare London.\\n\\nBritain’s position in 1805 is better than might be expected, but not due to its own efforts: Napoleon has managed to upset almost every other nation in Europe with his high-handedness. This is an opportunity for the British to build a new alliance, although this will mean paying handsome subsidies to its partners. As long as the Royal Navy can keep control of the seas, Britain is safe from invasion, but without a substantial army and continental allies this counts for little against France. Britain can contribute to the downfall of France, but needs time and resolve to muster its strength. Napoleon may not grant that time.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rHorse3_equestrian_estate_european	\\n\\nThis large, palatial estate specialises in the breeding and training of horses and helps to make the recruitment of cavalry units a great deal cheaper. Its main purpose is to provide mounts for cavalry regiments, thus allowing new units to be raised. As well as improving the cavalry regiments of an army, an equestrian estate will add substantially to the agricultural wealth of a region.\\n\\nHistorically, Napoleon favoured white or grey Arabian horses over the more traditional thoroughbreds. These animals were put through an incredibly rigorous training regime before they were ridden by Napoleon. Trained by his riding master, they were subjected to gunfire, swords and flags being waved in front of them, drums, trumpets and other instruments being played without warning, and they even had animals driven between their legs. These horses had to be ready for any eventuality on and off the battlefield. Napoleon enjoyed riding for pleasure and was almost killed when a horse bolted and threw him against a tree.	false

This wada (or residential complex) was never intended for the king, but to be an official residence for prime ministers and his administration of the Maratha Empire. No expense was spared in its construction: every door in the building was hand-carved from the finest teak; every floor was the finest marble available. The palace took two years to complete, and later prime ministers made it grander still, adding bastions, and magnificent gardens.\\n\\nWhen designed, the Shaniwar Wada was as much a fortress as palace. An army attempting to breach its gates faced formidable defences.\\n\\nThe building still exists, although it is much reduced from its former grandeur. A fire in 1828 destroyed much of the original, leaving only the granite structures undamaged.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_opera_house_indian	\\n\\nIndia is the birthplace of many cultures and arts, and the ruling classes have enough money to demand – and pay for – the best of everything. This creates a demand for skilled artisans of many kinds, and a demand for training in the arts from rich dilettantes who wish to dabble for themselves and, after all, an educated patron can spend his money wisely. There are schools specialising in every art, from erotic temple statuary to manuscript illumination – and everything in between.\\n\\nHistorically, some of the finest buildings and artistic achievements in India were created during the period of Mughal rule, in a style that can be called Islamo-Indian.

Winning the hearts and minds of the locals is a large portion of winning a war and can make controlling a country significantly easier. Complete annexation provides an excellent bonus to your income and increases the resistance to future foreign occupation in French-occupied territories.\\n\\nOpposition to the French and their godless Revolution was always strong in Spain, particularly in Catalonia. The Spanish War of Independence saw the people of Spain rise to defend their country from the foreign invaders. In an attempt to quell Spanish distrust Napoleon annexed Catalonia into the French Empire in 1812. He even declared Catalan to be the official language in a vain attempt to placate the locals, but all to no avail. The idea was sound, but the Catalans were having none of it. Guerrilla activity persisted in the area right up until 1814 when Wellington signed the armistice that drove the French from many of their strongholds in Spain, including Catalonia.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Art_Foot_Grand_Battery_Convention	\\n\\nWith twice as many guns as an ordinary artillery unit, the Grand Battery is an exceptionally strong unit. Its cannons have both a long range and tremendous killing power. However, it is vulnerable to cavalry attack even when not emplaced, as it is slow moving. The gun crews are only armed with swords and relatively untrained in hand-to-hand combat. Fighting is not their task: serving the guns is their only duty.\\n\\nThe Grand Battery was the turning point of Napoleon Bonaparte’s career: he was promoted to brigadier-general thanks to his skills and drive. As a trained artillerist, he knew that the real killing power in an army was in the heavy guns, not musketry or sabres. The idea of a Grand Battery was used in many of his later battles. It relied on weight of fire against a single section of an enemy line to blow a hole through any enemy defences. Against the storm of shot that a grand battery could produce, flesh stood little chance. The best defence was to use a reverse slope and hide behind the crest of a hill, rather than endure such a bombardment.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sArmy3_drill_school_european	\\n\\nDrill is not simply a means of keeping soldiers busy by having them march up and down. On the battlefield all manoeuvres must be performed exactly, at the correct time, if a unit is not to be shot down or cut to pieces. Every man must be drilled to perform his part correctly when a unit moves from a line formation to square, else confusion will result. Obedience to orders must be second nature: a soldier who is concentrating on not attracting the attention of his sergeant will also be too busy to worry about the enemy! Long hours of drill do have another, inadvertent benefit: men on a parade ground are not in the local tavern.\\n\\nDrill, for all its boredom for the men, was a vital practice for all armies of the Napoleonic period. Even the armies of France realised that revolutionary zeal was not enough, and some order had to be brought to battle. Many armies, however, were late in adopting a single drill manual for their forces; for a few fortunate and literate officers, this was a godsend. They could earn quite handsome additional funds by producing privately written drill books.	false

The men are armed with smoothbore muskets and bayonets, and drilled to use the most of the tactics of light and line infantry. Their only real weakness is that, when under threat from cavalry, they cannot form square.\\n\\nThe first battalion of fusiliers for the Prussian army was formally created in 1787. Its origins, however, went back to the “Free Regiments” of the Seven Years War; those units had a reputation for ill-discipline, roguish behaviour and desertion, even at a time when desertion was a common problem. Indeed, desertion remained a problem for many armies, especially among the men conscripted into light skirmishing units. Skirmishers often operate away from direct control by sergeants and officers, and can slip away in the heat of battle, if they really want to desert.	false

start_pos_factions_description_803546045	Prussia has a proud military heritage: what else could be the case for the nation of Frederick the Great? The country has been at peace for ten years, the result of getting a free hand in northern Germany east of the Rhine in exchange for recognising French control west of the Rhine. Political realities have to be recognised.\\n\\nNapoleon, however, is not an easy neighbour to endure. His ambitions are seemingly limitless, his army is growing every day, and he is in need of new victories to add lustre and legitimacy to his crown. It may only be a matter of time before he once again looks to secure the borders of France through war. Perhaps, though, he can be persuaded to go south, against Austria, even if that only leaves a stronger France to face at a later date.\\n\\nThere are allies available, if the Prussians can stomach them. The British are condescending and unwilling to fight on land, but they have the wealth needed to finance a war. The Russians and Austrians may be willing to help bring down the upstart empire of Napoleon, even as they will do their best to hamper Prussian ambitions. Neither the Austrians nor the Russians have any wish to see Germany or Poland dominated by Prussia, even as they prepare for war against France. Such then, is the situation facing Frederick William III. Danger and opportunity await.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_British_88th_Foot	\\n\\nA little rough around the edges, but courageous and professional on the battlefield, the Connaught Rangers are an Irish line infantry regiment. Whether pushing home a bayonet or forming a disciplined firing line, these men will stand and fight. Like all line infantry, they are vulnerable to artillery fire and the sniping of skirmishers, but they can quickly counter cavalry charges by forming square.\\n\\nRaised in 1793, the Connaught Rangers were among the best regiments in Wellington’s army, and distinguished themselves repeatedly in battle. General Picton, their divisional commander, saw them as little more than a plundering rabble and never held back from insulting their Irish roots and Catholic religion. This was probably the result of an unfortunate incident involving two Rangers and a goat. The Rangers caught Wellington’s eye at the Battle of Bussaco in 1810, when he declared that he never witnessed a more gallant charge. They attacked without orders from General Picton who was notably absent from the battle!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Austrian_German_Fusiliers	\\n\\nGerman Fusiliers are line infantry who take their title from the fusils, light flintlock muskets, that they carry. Forming the line of battle, they must be able to calmly take aim at their targets as shells explode around them, skirmisher’s shots smack home, and enemy cavalry bear down upon them. Fusiliers are effective against cavalry when in square, and excel in close combat, but care needs to be taken against skirmishers at extreme range.\\n\\nHistorically, the Austrian army’s infantry was divided into German and Hungarian regiments. The Hungarians were renowned for their ferocity, and the Germans for rigid discipline. This was particularly true of the fusiliers who fought in the rigid formations that made up the bulk of the army. During the Napoleonic Wars, units such as skirmishers, grenadiers and artillery took on more of the fighting as tactics evolved, but the line regiments remained almost unchanged as organisations. Their company and battalion structure still forms the basis of modern armies.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_roads_cobbled	\\n\\nBuilding a cobbled road is an incredibly laborious business. Each small paving stone must be shaped, placed and mortared into position. If done properly, the road also requires foundations, a careful camber to carry away rain water, and extensive drainage on either side. The end result is a fine road that is extremely durable, but not entirely comfortable for carts, carriages or foot traffic: cobbles can be hellishly bumpy!\\n\\nHistorically, the expense of cobbles, and the fine-looking result of cobbling a street, meant that they were often only used in or near towns or for high-status routes where the great and the good could not be expected to wallow in the mud like poor people. Cobbles, however, did serve the poor in another way: they were the perfect size for rioters! Levered out of place, they were the ideal thrown weapon (along with the half-house brick or “brickbat”) for a bit of informal remonstrating with any nearby unwelcome representatives of law and order.	false

Stables add to the agricultural wealth of a region, although producing draft animals is not their primary purpose.\\n\\nHistorically, the national stud farms of France were closed during the Revolution because they were seen as a symbol of the decadent aristocracy. When Napoleon came to power he re-opened them and proceeded to recreate France’s breeding stock, taking stallions from conquered enemies. He kept a personal stable of about eighty horses, most of which were good-tempered and gentle gallopers. Growing up in Corsica, Napoleon never received any formal training in the equestrian arts and many reported that his riding style was practical, but lacking in refinement. It is also worth noting that a general has better things to do in battle than worry about controlling his horse.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Gren_Grenadiers	\\n\\nGrenadiers see themselves as elite soldiers, and occupy the place of honour at the right of the line on parade. They have good reason: only large, brave men become grenadiers, this size and strength makes them an impressive sight in a charge. It also gives them an advantage in melee combat. Grenadiers are a proud group and this pride makes for dedicated soldiers who will follow orders to the letter. Like other infantry, they must exercise caution when facing heavy cavalry, but they are also vulnerable to attack from skirmishers.\\n\\nHistorically, grenadier regiments and battalions began as ad-hoc assault groups. All line infantry regiments had grenadier companies; collecting these sub-units gave commanders a useful group of heavily armed, aggressive and skilful soldiers. Grenadier companies remained in line infantry regiments after the creation of grenadier regiments, but they largely abandoned using grenades: instead, each grenadier company became a “heavy mob” of the biggest and strongest soldiers in a regiment!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_magistrate_european	\\n\\nLaw and order are the basis of good, bad and indifferent government. Appointed as a judge for his local standing, the magistrate of a region often acts as an administrator, tax collector, thief-taker, leader in charitable good works, military recruiter and father figure to his community. A magistrate usually represents both the state and the landed classes. It is his task, as often as not, to protect the rights of property rather than of people, even when a republican regime is in power – liberty and equality are all very well, but the deserving rich need to be sure their wealth is safe!\\n\\nMagistrates also often have the power to raise troops as formed units, and to send convicted men into the military as a punishment. The magistrate, therefore, becomes the first line of defence against the mob in times of disorder.	false

The saying “No money, no Swiss” dates back to at least the Renaissance, when Swiss mercenaries were regarded as among the best in Europe. When paid, there were no fiercer soldiers. By the Napoleonic era, Swiss units were exclusive to the French army and the Papal Swiss Guard of the Vatican. At the Battle of Berezina, the Swiss covered the French retreat under fire from the Russians, and this brave service was immortalised in the song “Beresinalied”.	false

start_pos_factions_description_917503112	Spain, once the conqueror of other nations, is now an unstable and fractured country. There is no valid central government, its king is a hated foreigner foisted on them by an invasion, and their oldest enemies are set to become their greatest allies.\\n\\nUntil recently Spain was allied with Bonaparte’s France and dreamt of sharing in the spoils of France’s new glorious empire. Napoleon, however, betrayed Spain’s trust, overthrowing the Spanish government and putting his own brother, Joseph, on the throne. Instead of the minor trouble Napoleon expected, he was faced with a revolt of such scale and ferocity that his army of occupation could not stop it. For the first time, France’s seemingly invincible armies were shaken, not by an enemy in the field, but by the Spanish people.\\n\\nUp to now, with no universally recognised central government, Spain has been ruled by small juntas, and internal quarrels and a lack of organisation mean that the Spanish Army has had little leadership. The Spanish guerrilla bands, groups of freedom fighters using the tactics of brigands, may be Spain’s greatest assets, but their military strength is negligible, and more suited to raiding rather than open warfare. The correct use of these forces and a strategy that plays to any and all Spanish strengths may be the key to pushing back, and, ultimately, beating the French. Britain could be a valuable ally against the common enemy, but the British must always be watched carefully. Spain has not been fortunate in her allies, and the British are among the oldest of Spain’s enemies.\\n\\nSpain, then, must look to build up her forces, while using her guerrilla bands to keep the French busy. At the same time, building an alliance with Britain, no matter how painful, is a necessary evil.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_grand_opera_house_european	\\n\\nLittle expense is spared on a grand opera house, particularly in the “front of house” areas where the audience are to be found. A grand opera house is a magnificent structure, the equal of any palace in terms of luxurious appointments and detailing to overawe the visitors. The staged works can be equally elaborate, featuring enormous casts and intricate settings. This is conspicuous consumption raised to a high art, even before the music starts!\\n\\nMany rulers in the 18th Century acted as a patron of the arts, and opera in particular. Apart from being fabulously and famously expensive (therefore demonstrating the patron’s wealth), the musical form was also growing in popularity and quality. The staging and music of opera advanced tremendously during the period, with works from composers of genius such as Mozart, Handel, and Scarlatti. Emperor Joseph II of Austria, the “music king”, was particularly fortunate that his love of the art coincided with a flowering of musical talent in Europe. He used the arts as a subtle tool of nationalism, promoting a Germanic culture within Austria.	false

The mastery of the many styles and forms is a lifetime’s work, but one that can bring rich rewards. A student cannot sign work until he had received an “icazet” or diploma, granted for producing an examination piece in the presence of several teachers. Standards are exceptionally high, but a recognized calligrapher could expect to have his work treasured by his clients.\\n\\nCalligraphy also forms the basis of some Islamic decoration (along with geometric arabesque art) and has a figurative style where interweaved words create images. These “calligrams” are both intricate and incredibly beautiful artworks. Calligraphy also has influences on other artistic endeavours, such as the creation of elaborate carpets and textiles.	false

Yet they were also known to avoid bloodshed if they could, at least among themselves. Feuding was costly, in both time and blood, and a wise man knew that it was better to talk than to reach for the knife. This same attitude was not always extended to outsiders: raiding and theft from non-Bedouin were honourable ways to support a family.	false

start_pos_factions_description_-45290171	Great Britain is a constitutional monarchy, a nation of free trade and personal liberty. Its people are seemingly devoted to making money and disliking foreigners in equal measure. Foreigners are, quite simply, just not very good at anything, be that running an empire or making a decent pie. Britons make no secret of their prejudice, a crass attitude that makes diplomacy difficult. The “English” as, much to the annoyance of the Scots, everyone calls them, are disliked in every court in Europe for this arrogance and their willingness to let everyone else do all the fighting and dying against the French. The apparent truth of this last point has been a gift to Bonaparte.\\n\\nIf the British do have a truly visceral dislike, then it would be the French, thanks to traditional rivalry and a genuine horror at the consequences of the French Revolution. While many British politicians were pleased to see an end to the Bourbon monarchy, they were repulsed by the insatiable bloodshed of the Terror, and fearful that the infection of revolution might cross the English Channel, with or without French bayonets to help it along. Invasion is a constant fear and, as always, an enemy in control of the Low Countries is enough to scare London.\\n\\nBritain’s position in 1805 is better than might be expected, but not due to its own efforts: Napoleon has managed to upset almost every other nation in Europe with his high-handedness. This is an opportunity for the British to build a new alliance, although this will mean paying handsome subsidies to its partners. As long as the Royal Navy can keep control of the seas, Britain is safe from invasion, but without a substantial army and continental allies this counts for little against France. Britain can contribute to the downfall of France, but needs time and resolve to muster its strength. Napoleon may not grant that time.	false

Napoleon has never given Spain his personal attention, but he has sunk money and troops into a Spanish war. He has made his brother Joseph, the former King of Naples, the putative foundation of a new Bonaparte dynasty in Spain. But the people have not come to heel. The Spanish are now fighting as though the struggle is a war of independence: their tactics are barbaric at times. Bandits and brigands crawl all over the countryside, mercilessly killing French troops sent to keep the peace, thwarting sensible attempts to make the country governable.\\n\\nAs well disgruntled locals, the French also face the perfidious British. They have used their old alliance with Portugal as an excuse to strike against Napoleon, building a defensive position at Torres Vedras that makes any attack on Portugal incredibly difficult.  The British commander, Wellington, has a fair grasp of logistics and the respect of his men: always a dangerous combination. He will need to be swiftly dealt with if France is to stand any chance of keeping control in Spain.\\n\\nFrance, then, faces difficulties in Spain. As an occupying power in an unfriendly land, there is no front line. But France also has the finest army in Europe, and able generals to command them.	false

start_pos_factions_description_397062659	Portugal is a quietly proud, independent, sea-faring nation with a long, mutually beneficial relationship with Britain. A French invasion has recently been pushed back with the aid of the British, but it is only a matter of time before the French send reinforcements.\\n\\nPortugal’s monarch, Maria I, has gone to Brazil to preserve a legitimate Portuguese government in exile. This policy of safety is sensible, because any conqueror will not be able to remove the rightful queen. Though Portugal is still under threat from the French, Portuguese arms and allies can gather their strength and defend the independence the country has always enjoyed.\\n\\nRecently, Portugal’s army has undergone significant reforms. The army has always fought bravely, but now it has been modernised and transformed into an effective fighting force. Portugal itself is not only protected by the Spanish mountain border, but by the Lines of Torres Vedras: a line of forts across the country with the lands in front levelled by a scorched earth policy. For any would-be attackers, there is no cover or comfort for miles. To end the French threat once and for all, defence is not enough. Napoleon has a vast disciplined “Army of Portugal”, but he also has many enemies who are willing to form an alliance against him.\\n\\nPortugal faces all the problems of a small nation fighting a greater power. Without allies, the Portuguese can only hope to live in a state of siege.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_pNavy3_steam_drydock_european	\\n\\nIt is a magnificent achievement of industry: a manufactory for ships where men work amid the flames of engines and furnaces to produce warships of tremendous size and power. Beam engines are used to pump water out of docks, but other engines are used to power sawmills, lathes, block-making machines and dockside cranes: where craftsmen would once have laboured, heavy machinery does their work. Like much steam industry, however, it is also a horrible and dangerous place to work, and a steam drydock does less than nothing to make the lower classes of a region feel happy.\\n\\nHistorically, the technology for draining drydocks was simply that used to pump water out of mines: the problem and the solution were identical. However, once steam power was in traditional docks, its uses quickly spread, simply because of the work needed to keep a fleet in operation. By the time of the Napoleonic Wars, the British Royal Navy was the largest industrial organisation in the world, let alone the largest combat force. The admirals, for all their love of tradition, were always quick to appreciate any new development that strengthened their beloved service.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_theatre_middle_east	\\n\\nThe word came to English through Italian, where the Turkish “serai” (palace) was confused with the Latin word “sera” (door-bar). A “serai” was any grand palace built around a courtyard, not just a harem. Despite this confusion, there were separate quarters for concubines (Circassian girls were highly prized for their reputedly amazing good looks), and access was tightly controlled.\\n\\nThe whole idea of a seraglio became something of an obsession in Western Europe, and the subject matter of many works of art in “Turkish” Oriental style, which was quite popular during the 18th Century. Obviously, it combined the exotic and the naughtily erotic in tasteful pictures for the rich! The concept provided the inspiration for Mozart’s opera, “Die Entführung aus dem Serail” (Abduction from the Seraglio), where the hero attempts to rescue his love from the clutches of an Ottoman Pasha. First performed in Austria in 1782 under the (indirect) patronage of the Austrian Emperor, Joseph II, there has to be a suspicion that anti-Turkish sentiment informed the piece. Nevertheless, the opera was a success and personally very profitable for Mozart.	false

Field repairs can be made by taking usable parts from a destroyed weapon to repair a damaged one. A single serviceable weapon may be created from the wreckage of a number of other guns.\\n\\nIn 1764, French artillery officer Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval created a system of standardisation of mass produced gun parts that came to be known as ‘Le systéme Gribeauval’. He improved cannon carriages, and improved the basic manufacturing of guns so that pieces became smaller and lighter for a given calibre.\\n\\nIt was Napoleon’s ability to use the existing systems of the French army to full effect that made it such an effective fighting force.

technologies_long_description_admin5_national_propaganda	\\n\\nNewspapers, broadsheets, pamphlets, flyers, and posters can all be used to tell people about the glory won on the battlefield and the evil schemes of other nations. Such carefully crafted messages can also aid agents. A gentleman who is working for a noble, worthwhile cause will find it easier to persuade others to support it if he has a plausible version of the truth on his side. The morale of an army may also be increased in battle if soldiers believe in the righteousness of the national cause.\\n\\nIn reality, Napoleon was a master of using the press to burnish his own reputation, and to prepare the nation for changes in policy.  The “Moniteur” newspaper, and other Parisian journals, harped on the perfidious intentions of Britain at every opportunity. Oddly, however, Napoleon was incensed when British newspapers returned the favour and traduced his reputation, and was considered by some to be angry enough over the matter to declare war. He didn’t seem to notice that the British press were horrid about everyone, and were as rude about “Prinny”, their own lardy, indolent, pie-guzzling, womanizing, booze-sodden, and debauched Prince Regent, as they were about a short Corsican in a funny hat. Some things never change.	false
building_description_texts_long_description_great_museum_european	\\n\\nSome objects in the collection are the spoils of war, gifts from travellers, the items collected on the whims of past rulers, and intriguing curios from around the world. This is, in many ways, the national equivalent of a savant’s “cabinet of curiosities”: a miscellany of interesting things, collected simply because they were interesting. The other half of the collection is a clear demonstration of national prowess in all fields, be that a piece of intricate machinery, a work of superlative craftsmanship, the largest cannon in the world, and so on. It is understandable if a certain chauvinism creeps into the enterprise: it is an exercise in national trumpet-blowing!\\n\\nHistorically, private museums and displays had developed from the collections in “cabinets of curiosities”, and some of these had ended up as government or royal property. The world-famous British Museum began in just this way, when Sir Hans Sloane’s collection was left to George II so that it could be preserved for the nation. Now a wonderful collection of antiquities, the Museum was intended to be a universal collection, and had natural history, geology, and science exhibits.	false

start_pos_factions_description_934184270	There are matters to be settled between the house of Hapsburg and the upstart Bonaparte.\\n\\nFrancis I is the first Hapsburg monarch to use the title Emperor of Austria. His ancient possessions in the Holy Roman Empire have been largely stripped away by a series of military disasters inflicted by the "Emperor" Napoleon. The old Empire is no more. In Italy and Germany, General Bonaparte personally oversaw military campaigns that broke Austrian Hapsburg dominance. Despite a relatively generous peace settlement in 1801, the Hapsburg throne lost too much.\\n\\nFrance remains a threat: it is unlikely that Napoleon can ever let matters rest as they are now. His legitimacy as a ruler is bought and paid for in military glory, and that cannot be won in times of peace. His attitude towards other nations is tinged with contempt at best, and hostility at worst. Austria, then, has to choose sides. Fortunately, there are potential allies in the Russians and the British. Indeed, the British may be ideal allies, for they are likely to want the return of Hanover, thus weakening Prussian power within Germany. They also have an exceptionally large amount of money to help finance their continental allies.\\n\\nThe Russians will expect to be compensated for any efforts against Napoleon by Polish territory, but Austria can put up with such an arrangement. The difficulty may lie in coming to an arrangement with Prussia: can Germany be divided equably? But there is much to be gained by finding allies: Austria needs help if she is to regain the lost lands of Italy and, finally, remove the revolutionary threat that is France.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tCommerce1_market_european	\\n\\nThe sights, sounds, and smells of a modern market differ somewhat to the days of old. Now they team with goods from all over the world, coffee from the Ottoman Turks, wool from Britain, furs from the United States, and spices from India. This wide variety of commodities helps to increase industrial wealth as well as town wealth.\\n\\nNapoleon attempted to use trade and the restriction thereof to cripple the British war effort. He correctly understood that money was the basis of British power. His attack on Egypt, as well as serving his own interests, was intended to destroy, eventually, Britain’s trade in India. When Napoleon took control of France he continued his attempted strangulation of Britain’s trade by issuing a number of decrees against trade with Britain. The first of these was the Berlin Decree of 1806. The British government responded with a blockade of French-controlled Europe and ordered Royal Navy vessels to seize any ships, hostile or neutral, violating the blockade.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_steam-pumped_gold_mine_european	\\n\\nPumping or lifting the water allows the miners to reach richer, deeper mineral seams. A steam beam engine, linked to a pump, can lift enough water to make it economically sensible to dig deep shafts. \\n\\nHistorically, Thomas Newcomen was the first to develop a practical “atmospheric” engine for draining deep mines sometime around 1710. His design had problems and was very inefficient, but it worked well enough to be widely adopted where coal was cheap. It was an atmospheric engine because the steam was never under pressure, and relied on a partial vacuum forming when the steam cooled, thus sucking the piston down the cylinder. The need to repeatedly warm and then cool the machine made it wasteful. \\n\\nJames Watt’s beam engine design was altogether more efficient. He had a separate steam condenser, and kept the cylinder at a constant temperature. He was also lucky in his choice of working partner, Matthew Boulton, who proved to be an astute business manager and lobbyist: he even persuaded the British Parliament to extend their patent, guaranteeing them further profit!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_army_board_european	\\n\\nIt is a truism that soldiers have little time for the bureaucrats who send them their orders. Some organisation above the level of a regiment is, however, a necessary evil: supplies must be purchased and distributed, transport organised, officers’ promotion lists kept in order, and generals given their orders. All this means paperwork, paperwork, and more paperwork! Money, and the power to spend it, are vitally important and all government secretariats are keen to hold on to both.\\n\\nHistorically, the government departments that ran armies in the 18th Century were far from being defence ministries or anything approaching a general staff. A central war planning function was almost unheard of, and often generals were quite unwilling to deal with the authorities at home, preferring to control everything themselves. In Europe the army organisations dealt with pay and rations: often spending time making sure that colonels did really raise regiments they were being paid for! The Ottomans were much more organised, and their armies were on a professional footing and raised on a national basis, even if some of the units raised were rather old fashioned.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tReligion3_cathedral	\\n\\nThese colleges give Catholic students a good grounding in many disciplines, as well as making sure that their faith is certain. A few pupils receive scholarships or charity, but the majority of them are the children of the upper reaches of society. Many great Spaniards have been given an unshakeable belief in Spanish greatness, and the intellectual tools to attempt the task. Catholic colleges have an essentially conservative bent, and exist to support the existing political and social order, not make students question the status quo. \\n\\nDuring the Peninsular War, the Catholic Church held great power in Spain. Teachers needed to take religious oaths before they were even allowed to teach, ensuring that there were no dangerous firebrands waiting to instil heretical thoughts in their pupils. Before the war, in France, Church property was seized and the authority of the Pope curbed. Mindful of the Church’s power, Napoleon sought reconciliation through a Concordat in 1801. This affirmed Catholicism as the majority religion of France and made the Sabbath a holiday once more. Such changes were seen as only posturing by the faithful of Spain.	false

technologies_long_description_economy3_limited_liability_company	\\n\\nTrade and enterprise are among the building blocks of any fledgling empire, and therefore any business is to be encouraged and aided. The shareholders in a limited liability company are not held personally accountable for any company debts. They are not expected to use any more of their own money, beyond what they paid for their shares, to honour the company’s commitments. Shareholders face less risk as a result, and this not only increases the wealth of a nation, but also its gross national product.\\n\\nWhen the Act of Limited Liability was passed in the United Kingdom in 1855 it was met with some scepticism. The public feared that companies would be free to act irresponsibly because their owner could walk away from the financial consequences. To prevent this, shares were only partly paid to begin with so that in the event of company bankruptcy shareholders would still have to pay the balance for shares in a worthless enterprise. However, as only the already wealthy could afford the risk, this approach was soon abandoned, and business boomed.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Gren_Prussian_East_Prussian_Grenadiers	\\n\\nAll grenadiers regard themselves as elite, and occupy the place of honour at the right of the line on parade. They have good reason: only the largest, bravest men can become grenadiers; this size and strength makes them an impressive sight in a charge, and gives them an edge in melee. They are vulnerable when charged by heavy cavalry and when attacked by skirmishers. Those points aside, grenadiers are a proud group and they are dedicated soldiers who will follow orders to the letter.\\n\\nHistorically, the Prussian army went through a radical reorganisation following Napoleon’s downfall in 1814. In October of that year the six existing grenadier battalions became two regiments and, as a mark of respect, the King of Prussia named these regiments after his allies, Czar Alexander of Russia and Emperor Francis of Austria. The Kaiser Alexander Grenadier Regiment was formed of the 1st and 2nd East Prussian battalions and the Life; the Kaiser Franz regiment was formed of men from the Pomeranian, West Prussian and Silesian battalions.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Austrian_Archduke_Charles_Legion	\\n\\nAs part of the Archduke’s military reforms, these troops are trained in the latest military style in a bid to copy the success of Napoleon’s Grande Armée. This training improves accuracy, reloading and close combat skills. There is also a morale effect: the men are filled with a renewed confidence that makes them unlikely to rout. However, as with most line infantry, they have little defence against units such as artillery or skirmishing snipers and will be at a disadvantage against elite infantry.\\n\\nIn 1806, Austria was still reeling from her defeat by France at Austerlitz. Austrian conservatism and tradition had resulted in an outdated and outmatched army, and its defeat by the French forced them to accept the harsh terms of the Treaty of Pressburg. Archduke Charles, a highly respected field-marshal, recognised that the Austrian army needed modernising and introduced a number of military reforms. These improvements were tested during the Peninsular War period when the Austrians formed the Fifth Coalition against France. It was during this coalition that the Legion took part in the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon’s first defeat in over ten years.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Art_Fix_Rocket_Troop	\\n\\nThe rockets these troops employ are iron tubes filled with gunpowder propellant; when fired in large volleys, the noise alone is unnerving and has a negative effect on enemy morale. Each rocket is laid in an angled launcher, and it is the job of the artilleryman to correctly judge the angle of launch so that the rockets drop in the middle of the enemy. He also needs to take into account wind, as the long tails of the rockets make them inaccurate. The fixed nature of this artillery means the crewmen are incredibly vulnerable to attack, especially from fast moving cavalry.\\n\\nHistorically, it was the Indian war rockets used by Tippu Sultan of Mysore that introduced Europeans to rocket bombardment. The British copied these weapons as the Congreve rocket system, and used them aboard ships as well as on land. A rocket troop was present at the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, although accounts of their effectiveness vary. Congreve’s system even included illumination rounds to light up the battlefield!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Russian_Moscow_Musketeers	\\n\\nThese troops are battle-hardened veterans, making them invaluable on the battlefield. Formed into a disciplined line, they can unleash a massed volley into an enemy then, while the enemy is reeling, follow it with a decisive bayonet charge. For all their experience, they are still vulnerable to fire from artillery or skirmish units, but they can form square to counter potentially murderous cavalry charges.\\n\\nIn 1812, Napoleon marched his Grand Armée into Moscow, expecting a great victory and abject surrender by Tsar Alexander I. However, the French were hit hard by starvation on the march to Moscow: the foraging that served them well in richer parts of Europe backfired in Russia’s bleak landscape, made more bleak by the Russian habit of burning everything in their path. The French were desperate to find supplies in Moscow, but the Russians continued their denial policy, stripped the city of everything moveable and burned the rest. Robbed of victory and food, the Grand Armée pulled back, and marched into a Russian winter. Napoleon left at least three-quarters of his army, frozen and starved to death, on the steppes.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_poland_lazienki_park	\\n\\nThe Park and its gardens were acquired by Stanislaw II August Poniatowski, the last King and Grand Duke of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, after his election. Although already impressive, he set about remodelling them, and made the gardens his life’s work, building his “Palace on the Water” in a suitably magnificent setting by the Lake. This watery connection was how the park got its name of Lazienki or “Royal Baths” Park, after the bathing pavilion that was constructed in the gardens.\\n\\nThe garden was also a magnificent setting for Stanislaw’s regular dinner parties with leading artists, writers and politicians. While Stanislaw was something of an autocrat, he was also a believer in education and the ideas of the Enlightenment, using the dinners to engage with leading thinkers.\\n\\nThe park and palaces were lucky to survive the Warsaw Rising in 1944. They were mined for destruction, but the German occupiers never completed their demolition works, although the Lazienki Palace was burned.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_roads_basic	\\n\\nConstructing roads allows local goods to reach nearby markets, and gives some useful work to paupers and work-shy individuals who would otherwise be moved on or require expensive charity. At the very least, the larger rocks have been moved out of the road, pounded to pieces and the resulting rubble used as a roadbed. Drainage ditches mean the road ceases to be a convenient gutter for rainwater, and a muddy hell for anyone trying to use it.\\n\\nHistorically, there was often a military imperative for building roads. Troops and artillery require good roads for strategic redeployments and rapid reaction. In Scotland, General Wade completed a network of roads to “Roman” standards during the 1720s so that armies could quickly move into the rebellious Highlands – the Jacobite supporters of the ousted Stuart dynasty were a constant threat. His achievement was celebrated in a (now defunct) verse of the then-new British anthem:\\n\\nLord, grant that Marshal Wade\\nMay, by thy mighty aid,\\nVictory bring.\\nMay he sedition hush\\nAnd, like a torrent, rush\\nRebellious Scots to crush.\\nGod save the King.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_royal_academy_european_gov_absolute_monarchy	\\n\\nAcademies concern themselves with all aspects of national cultural and scientific life. From the most abstract of mathematical conundrums to the collections of natural wonders and the study of languages and lexicography, nothing is outside the interests of academicians. The members are, by and large, selected by their peers, although individual governments do use their influence to secure places for worthy men – and these learned societies are not above granting membership to royalty in the hope of securing patronage!\\n\\nLarge projects were matters of national prestige. The Académie Française, was charged with the collation of an official French dictionary. The epic voyage of Captain Cook, RN, in 1768–71 was partly influenced by the desire of the British Royal Society to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun from Tahiti. Other nations sent observers to, among other places, Canada and Siberia – Cook got the nicest destination! By observing the event from different sides of the Earth, parallax made it possible to calculate the size of the solar system and establish the astronomical unit.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sPrest_French_Arc_de_Triomphe	\\n\\nPride in one’s nation is a powerful thing, and what better way to instil national pride than to build a structure that celebrates the great achievements of the country? Be it past victories, advances in education and technology, or a collection of treasures, such structures provide a stage to display achievements to the world. National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\\n\\nThe Arc de Triomphe was the brainchild of Napoleon, and was intended as a grand celebration of the victories of his Imperial armies. He did not live to see its completion, and King Louis-Philippe formally inaugurated it in 1836. The arch was fashioned after the monuments of Imperial Rome, and it stands at an impressive 162 feet tall, making it the tallest triumphal arch in the world. It has been used to commemorate the French dead of both World Wars, and is the site of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Buried there in 1921, this unidentified body acts as a symbolic representation of all those unknown French soldiers who died in the Great War.	false

Pavlograd hussars are, without exception, excellent horsemen, ideal for chasing down skirmishers and overrunning artillery units. Though their charge is powerful, they are still weak against infantry in square and will suffer losses in prolonged close combat. Instead, they are better used to quickly attack, then break away and attack again.\\n\\nThe Pavlograd Hussars were immortalised in Tolstoy’s epic novel “War and Peace”, but their fame was well established before Tolstoy penned his masterpiece. In 1797, a young Georgian officer, Spiridon Zhevahov, took command of the Pavlograd Hussars and led them to impressive triumphs against Napoleon’s forces. The Hussars shocked the French by crushing the 3rd Lancers of the Young Guard, part of Napoleon’s personal guard. To add insult to injury, they also managed to capture the 3rd Lancers’ standard, a major blow to French prestige.	false

If something cannot be built for the purpose, then taking the extremely expensive home of a “dashed aristo” will do quite nicely!\\n\\nHistorically, the Palais Bourbon was built as a home for Louise-Françoise, duchesse de Bourbon, one Louis XIV’s legitimised bastards by one of his favourite mistresses, Françoise-Athénaïs de Montespan. The building, although rather magnificent and scarcely a hovel, was not technically a palace, because Louise-Françoise herself did not have royal rank. After the French Revolution, it was nationalised and used as a meeting place of the Council of Five Hundred. It is still a parliament building, now acting as home to the deputies of the French National Assembly, the lower legislative house of the French Republic. Louise-Françoise probably wouldn’t recognise her old home, as it has been extensively remodelled.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_barracks_middle_east	\\n\\nThe janissaries are the “yeni cheri” (literally the “new soldiers”) although they are the earliest organised, regularly paid, state army in existence in Europe. Recruited as child soldiers from among the non-Muslims of the Ottoman world, indoctrination produces superb warriors and unquestioningly loyal state functionaries. \\n\\nThe long, proud and bloody tradition of janissary victory and excessive zeal was a result and a cause of an almost-monastic training regime. This tradition as a “warrior order” influenced in turn the ascetic architectural style of their barracks. That, at least, is the theory. Lacking local loyalties, and having had their family ties broken, they became the “enforcers of empire” as well as its defenders because they had no reason to be sympathetic towards anyone not in their ranks.\\n\\nHistorically, however, the janissaries did not remain elite warriors and nothing else. They extended their reach into all aspects of the state bureaucracy, practiced a variety of trades and professions in addition to soldiering, and often lived a less-than-celibate lifestyle. They also became conservative in outlook and a real obstacle to any kind of political, military or social reform.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Republican_Horse_Guards	\\n\\n Heavy cavalry’s purpose is to break the enemy by shock. Simply put, the Horse Guards are expected to charge home and smash enemy ranks by weight and speed. They are not for chasing down enemies: this is the work of faster, lighter cavalry forces. Instead, they are a battering ram, hurled over short distances against close-formed enemies in the hope of producing a breakthrough and further confusion. However, when confronted by elite infantry in a square formation, these horsemen meet their match and charging blindly in could lead to heavy losses.\\n\\nHistorically, the Horse Guards Parade buildings in London were designed by William Kent, completed in 1755 and used for the “Trooping of the Colour”, a tradition that continues to this day. Indeed, the Horse Guards, as part of the Blues and Royals, themselves remain a feature of the modern British Army, although they now use tanks rather than horses.	false

technologies_long_description_economy5_mass_production	\\n\\nCraft-based manufacturing of any kind has a ceiling on the number of goods that it can produce. The goods themselves may be beautifully made, but the number of expert workers is the limitation; people can only make so many things if they are doing everything for themselves.\\n\\nMass production mechanises the basic and repetitive tasks of production, and divides work into simple, repetitive and repeatable tasks. No longer does a master craftsman labour to make one item from start to finish. Instead, work is broken down into simple tasks and each given to a worker with the item passing to the next person for the next task. Each job is simple, so mechanical aids and tools can be used in place of expertise.\\n\\nMarc Brunel (1769-1849) was a French engineer who fetched up in England after the French Revolution. His block-making machines are a typical example of mass production in the period. They let unskilled labour make the blocks and pulleys needed in their thousands by the Royal Navy – blocks were a vital part of ship’s rigging.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Skirm_Austrian_Windbucshe_Jager	\\n\\nRecruited from woodsmen, hunters and poachers, these men are used to moving across broken ground and staying unobserved by their prey. Their cleverly designed airguns can be reloaded very quickly by screwing in a new air reservoir and slotting home a new magazine of shot. The airgun is also rifled, making it a deadly weapon at long range. However, like all skirmishers the Windbüchse Jägers are vulnerable to being ridden down by cavalry and cannot be expected to last long against the massed fire of line infantry.\\n\\nHistorically, the windbüchse (“wind rifle”) was a fascinating “what if” of military history. It had a 20-round magazine, and could fire as quickly as the user could pull the trigger. The gun could drive a ball through a plank (or a man) at 100 paces, but it was a delicate weapon. Quiet, and without a tell-tale cloud of gunpowder smoke, the windbüchse did not work after rough treatment, something that was inevitable in battle. Napoleon Bonaparte hated them and decreed that any captured “assassin” with an airgun was to be executed, not treated as a soldier.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_British_KGL_Foot	\\n\\nWell-trained and well-respected, the foot regiments of the King’s German Legion are responsible for holding the line in battle. When deployed, they brave the threat of artillery fire, skirmishers and cavalry charges to unleash very effective volley fire upon the enemy. Cavalry charges should be countered by ordering them to form square. They fight with justifiable pride in their skills in close combat, giving opponents pause with their brutal use of bayonets.\\n\\nHistorically, the majority of the King’s German Legion was recruited from the Hanoverian Army, which had disbanded after Napoleon’s occupation of Hanover. Given that the British monarch was also Elector of Hanover, the British lost no time in creating a legion of Hanoverian exiles, ready to fight and die to destroy Napoleon. The British soon held the King’s German Legion in high regard due to their exemplary behaviour on the battlefield and in training. Hanoverian officers had a professional attitude towards war that was largely lacking in their native British counterparts, who considered tactics and drill beneath the notice of proper gentlemen.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCannon2_ordnance_factory_european	\\n\\nThe large-scale manufacturing of cannons is a monopoly retained by the state, even in a republic. The creation of large guns is also a difficult business, and the state is the only body that can afford to do it. The number of guns available is therefore a measure of national prestige, and the ability to produce guns, rather than buy them from foreigners, is equally prestigious. An ordnance factory allows artillery units to be recruited.\\n\\nHistorically, most ordnance factories began in royal ownerships, giving the monarch a guaranteed access to heavy cannons. These were needed for destroying the castles of recalcitrant barons! Even though politics moved on, the state control of cannon production remained. In Britain, for example, the Master of the Ordnance was often a member of the cabinet, and many royal households across Europe included a post of Master Gunner. Even the Ottoman Turks, who had a strong tradition of heavy artillery production, were careful to make sure the Sublime Porte had master gunners on staff.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Militia_Ottoman_Palestinian_Auxiliaries	\\n\\nThe primary task of auxiliaries is not necessarily to fight on the battlefield, but to intimidate local troublemakers and keep order in the streets. Because of this, they receive little training and, when pitted against regular soldiers, they are likely to run or be killed very quickly. However, for garrison duties and as a diversion on a battlefield they can be useful to a cunning commander.\\n\\nIn 1799 Napoleon besieged the Ottoman city of Acre in Palestine, echoing the Crusades that had taken place 700 years earlier. For once, Napoleon lacked artillery as British forces had ambushed it en route. His infantry would have to take Acre unsupported. After many attempts, new artillery was brought up and broke down the wall, only to reveal that the Ottomans had built an inner wall to seal the breach! After two months of failure and disease, Napoleon admitted defeat and withdrew his exhausted soldiers.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Light_French_Chasseurs	\\n\\nLight, fast and agile, these men are experts at forming a skirmishing screen, providing diversions for an advance, or rearguard cover for a withdrawal. Armed with muskets, they are equally adept when deployed in line and loose skirmish formations. Their range and accuracy are exemplary, but they lack the skills necessary for close combat; their inability to form square leaves them vulnerable to cavalry charges.\\n\\nHistorically, Napoleon’s chasseurs included both foot and mounted regiments. The foot regiments were named chasseurs à pied, and the men who served well in them could be rewarded by promotion to the prestigious grenadiers. The cavalry troops were known as the chasseurs à cheval, and had a rivalry with the French hussars. Each unit believed they were superior to the other, and this resulted in many arguments between them over who wore the most dashing clothes or were the better horsemen. Although the hussars had the more expensive uniforms, the chasseurs argued that Napoleon’s escort unit was made up of men from their ranks.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sAdmin1_tax_office_european	\\n\\nA tax office is never a welcome sight, and adds slightly to the repression of the region where it is found. It does, however, allow for more efficient tax collection and aids in the recruitment of military units. It is a necessary evil for government: no matter what the national constitution may be, or the political beliefs of the ruling classes, no government can do anything unless it has money.\\n\\nTaxation has always been the most resented part of government. Tax collectors often had quite draconian powers, and could call upon the services of the military to encourage the people to pay. This was often necessary, as taxes did not fall fairly on every part of the community: the poor often paid far more in relative and absolute terms, than the wealthy. The worst case was probably to be found in Spain, where the nobility, the landed gentry and the wealthy simply never bothered to pay taxes at all. The Napoleonic period also saw income tax levied for the first time in Great Britain in 1798. It was abolished in 1802, but governments tend to remember good ways of getting money out of the people!	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_4_Decker_Spanish_Santissima_Trinidad	\\n\\nThe Santissima Trinidad is, however, an unwieldy beast and hardly responsive to the helm. This, however, is entirely secondary to the enormous firepower that her captain has at his command. There is no ship in the world to rival her and few that even bear comparison.\\n\\nBuilt in Havana in 1769, the Santissima Trinidad was the pride of the Spanish navy. Although a masterpiece of contemporary construction techniques, she was built to a very old-fashioned design principle. Most naval architects were beginning to realise that overall functionality was more important than size and firepower, but this ship harked back to a time when a hefty broadside was the only consideration. It was obvious to many experienced Spanish officers that her power lay in defence, but this was overlooked and she was put to sea with the fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar (1805). She lost her sails under heavy fire from the British ships and was eventually forced to surrender, crippled and unable to bring her guns to bear, by HMS Neptune. Unfortunately, she was lost at sea during a storm after the battle.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tSupply2_supply_warehouse_european	\\n\\nAll armies can, if needs must, forage for supplies in the lands that they pass through. This can ruin the countryside for years, if the depredations are particularly savage. Food, shelter, and firewood are the easily obtainable items, although taking these usually means that the local population starves; is thrown out of its hovels, or palaces; and finds that every stick of furniture has been burned. However, an army cannot forage for what does not exist: gunpowder and arms. These have to be supplied from a central depot of some kind, and carried to the battle by a long train of supply wagons.\\n\\nUnlike the French and other continental armies, the British army was under orders to refrain from large scale foraging and pillaging. This decision was not based on mercy or some kind of misplaced politeness, but a result of a cold calculation. It was considered a better bargain to pay for most supplies, even if only in promissory notes, than alienate a complete population. As a result, British provosts were sometimes very busy hanging looters, but the British army never really had to worry about “banditti” or “guerillas” falling on their lines of communication.	false

When Frederick was crowned as “King in Prussia”, the Academy was granted royal patronage.\\n\\nUnder Frederick the Great, a man normally regarded as a warrior-king, the academy merged with Prussian Nouvelle Société Littéraire (French being a primary language of literature and culture in the 18th Century) and the Royal Academy of Sciences. He also offered cash prizes as incentives to the members to investigate and solve the scientific conundrums of the day. The Academy had its own laboratories, an observatory, libraries, an operating theatre (for public demonstrations of surgery), and gardens for plant specimens.	false

Their long limbs and striding gait make them incredibly manoeuvrable; their riders are armed with sabres and carbines, and excel in skirmish warfare. Able to effectively avoid trouble, their only major tactical weakness is when engaged in prolonged attacks against well-trained infantry or in melee against a superior cavalry unit.\\n\\nHistorically, camel cavalry were often used to panic enemy horses. All horses, unless accustomed to camels, hate their smell and became uncontrollable when near them. Camels have proven to be extremely useful beasts throughout the world: the one-humped dromedaries are now largely domesticated, with only a few living wild in their original homelands. There are, however, estimated to be 300,000 wild camels in Australia, escapees from the herd brought in to act as transport in the desert interior. At the time of writing, the Australian authorities are considering a cull, as the camel has no natural predators in the outback.	false

technologies_long_description_military4_local_guides	\\n\\nGetting help from local people is always a good idea for an army, even if this is obtained at the point of a sword. Without reliable official maps, it is the local man who knows the mountain passes, where to find water, or where the river can be forded. Collating this information from local guides improves the movement rates of armies and agents, and the swift passage of an army can be the difference between victory and defeat.\\n\\nHistorically, British operations in Spain were greatly assisted by the guerrilla’s ability to go anywhere. Their knowledge of the countryside meant that they were able to ambush unsuspecting Frenchmen and provide vital intelligence about the lay of the land. The Duke of Wellington complained that Spanish maps of their own lands were often completely inaccurate, and his “exploring officers” used local knowledge to produce more accurate maps. The French were not so lucky, as their repressive measures alienated people who could have helped with mapping.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tEducation3_enlightened_university_european	\\n\\nEach turn, a modern university has a very good chance of producing a gentleman, and it also significantly aids technology research in the region. The liberal thinking that occurs greatly improves the region's happiness, but also creates a strong desire for reform among the people. National pride in intellectual achievement is an important motive in the all the studies undertaken, along with personal pride and ambition. Ideas, however, are not confined to the intellectual elite, but passed on to everyone who can understand: learning inspires artists, poets and musicians, and well-read laymen.\\n\\nThe French Revolution was not always kind to scientists. On the one hand, Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) did not suffer greatly and was not forced out of the country on account of his Italian birth; Napoleon later named him as one of the Légion d'honneur. On the other hand, Antoine Lavoisier (1743-94), a man rightly hailed as the father of modern chemistry was, in the space of a single day, tried, condemned, and executed on trumped-up charges. His involvement in tax farming possibly counted against him, but in killing Lavoisier, a political liberal as well as a genius, France lost one of the greatest minds of all time.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_Ahmed_al-Jazzar_Pasha	\\n\\nA general inspires his men to greater efforts by his presence, if he truly has the gift of command. He need only obey the 17th Century military dictum of “pay well, command well, hang well” to ensure that his troops know exactly what is expected of them. Although it might be tempting to use a general in combat this is a waste. A general is not a combat unit: it is his job to command, not bathe his sword in the blood of enemies.\\n\\nAhmed al-Jazzar was an Ottoman pasha, or general, who was born in Bosnia, then a Turkish province. He is best known in Western histories for his successful defence of Acre when the city was besieged by Napoleon in 1799. Despite this heroic stand, the pasha was not loved by the people of Acre, or anywhere else unfortunate enough to suffer his rule. He was a cruel man, even in a time when cruelty was considered a legitimate tool of government. He was reputed to keep a mobile gallows to hand, so that those who offended could have the error of their ways swiftly corrected. He died in 1804, having rebuilt Acre to a large extent, but without being extravagantly mourned. His real achievement is in stopping Napoleon’s Syrian campaign before it could get properly started.	false

Although they are foot soldiers, and lack the dash and élan of cavalry, they take a justifiable pride in their worth in battle. They can form square when threatened by cavalry, and give other enemy infantry a bloody time but they are still vulnerable to shelling by artillery and sniping by skirmishers.\\n\\nThe fusiliers were considered the ordinary soldiers of Napoleon’s army. They enjoyed little of the prestige and privileges showered on the Emperor’s precious guards, his artillery formations, or the light troops. Yet they were vital to his victories: strong, dependable and loyal to Napoleon. They could be counted on to do his marshals’ bidding in almost every circumstance.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sheep_great_estates_european	\\n\\nThe largest estates are a statement of wealth, complete with dazzling palace-like grand houses in the latest styles and built without thought to the expense. Landowners and the great nobility vie with each other to produce not just houses, but idealized landscapes around them. Where the terrain is not dramatic enough, it is ruthlessly reorganised to suit the owner’s tastes. In the interests of art and beauty the workers, their homes, and their farms are removed from the land.\\n\\nHistorically, a group of landscape architects in Europe completely remodelled many country estates into idyllically perfect vistas for their clients. They created the fantasy of a natural landscape, improving on what was there to make entirely “artificial” (and this was not a term of disapproval at the time) parkland dotted with romantic ruins and gothic follies. In the process, men like Lancelot “Capability” Brown remade hills, flooded valleys, moved rivers, destroyed entire villages and displaced people without mercy. Many of these amazing houses and gardens still exist today, if only as tourist attractions.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_trading_port_european	\\n\\nMost roads are simply terrible, and bulk cargoes (such as coal) must go by ship anyway: it is the only way of moving goods cheaply and relatively quickly. It also makes the whole world a marketplace, even if the customers are not sure what to make of the goods they are being sent (British merchants insisted on exporting heavy woollen cloth to India for years, even though there was no obvious market for it).\\n\\nCoastal trade can also be very profitable. For example, a “cheese fleet” did nothing but shuttle back and forth between London and the northwest of England, bringing Cheshire cheeses to the London market. By a happy accident of geology, Cheshire had rock salt mines that provided a preservative for the local cheese to make the sea journey to London. Although salty, this was undoubtedly healthier than most food on a gentleman’s table in the 18th Century!	false

technologies_long_description_military2_top_gallants	\\n\\nAll sailing ships rely on the wind for motive power. The only practical way to make a better speed through the water at a particular wind velocity is to put on more sail. Each mast is designed to take a main sail and a topsail, but it is possible with top gallants to add an extra sail above the topsail. Naturally, this requires more yards, ropes and skilled sailors to set the sails. Adding a top gallant is also something of a strain on the fabric of the ship: the extra strain on a mast can, in high winds, rip it right out of a hull. This catastrophic damage to the whole ship can also cause casualties among the crew.\\n\\nThe speed and handling of a ship can also be improved by careening the hull: a process that takes days. This, however, is not something that will instantly give more speed, unlike setting the topgallants.	false

A general who carries the respect of his troops is a valuable asset and should be protected in battle. He should be kept away from the cut and thrust of battle, as he should have his mind on command, not dodging bullets.\\n\\nSwedish by birth, Gebhard von Blücher transferred his allegiance to Prussia after he was captured in 1760. However, a slight tendency towards excess often meant he was passed over for promotion, leading him to resign his commission in 1773. Upon receiving this resignation Fredrick the Great was reported to say “Captain Blücher can take himself to the devil.” He was blacklisted, and Blücher was unable to rejoin the army until after the death of Fredrick. Once back, he distinguished himself, going on to play one of the key roles in the Allied victory at Waterloo.	false

technologies_long_description_admin2_colonial_funding	\\n\\nColonial funding increases the income from trade nodes. Colonial possessions and the trade they generate are vital to great empires. The nation that controls the flow of trade wealth from all corners of the world controls the flow of cash to its rivals. Trade pays for wars: an under-funded war effort will fail. By investing in the good governance and physical assets of overseas colonies, the trade generated by those colonies is increased many fold. It is simply good business sense to make sure that there are docks as well as law and order throughout an empire.\\n\\nBritish involvement in the Peninsular War has its origins in trade. Following Nelson’s victory at Trafalgar in 1805, Napoleon sought to cripple Britain by prohibiting British trade with Europe. His “Continental System” apparently stopped all British trade with the European mainland. The Portuguese, however, saw no reason to obey French rules and carried on trading with the British. Napoleon demanded that Portugal suspend trade; the Portuguese cheerfully ignored his ultimatum, and Napoleon’s armies invaded in 1807. Britain now had a land ally worth supporting with troops: the British army arrived in the Peninsular in 1808 by sea, and marched into France, in company with Portuguese troops, after five years of hard fighting.	false

technologies_long_description_military1_carronade	\\n\\nCarronade differ from the normal warship “long guns” by having a shortened barrel, relative to the weight of shot. Short barrels require reduced gunpowder charges; large charges would be wasted because they would not have time to burn properly. This gives a reduced muzzle velocity, less recoil, and a lighter weapon. As a further benefit, carronades require fewer gunners to fire them. There is, however, a tactical price to pay: carronades are short-range weapons. In close, but only in close, they can do fearful slaughter.\\n\\nHistorically, the carronade was developed by the Carron Company of Fife, Scotland. It was a huge success initially, as the weight of shot more than made up for its short range: 68-pounder carronades were quite easily carried aboard even small ships. HMS Victory carried 68-pounder carronades as part of her armament: one raking round shot and a load of 500 musket balls did terrible slaughter on the gun deck of the Bucentaure at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Light_Lombardy-Cisalpine_Legion	\\n\\nThe Lombardy-Cisalpline Legion is trained to use an effective combination of loose and close knit formations. They are skirmishers, used to harass the enemy at long range before concentrating into a tighter formation for a last charge. Their versatility has some disadvantages however, and they may come unstuck against troops trained to specialise in one area of expertise.\\n\\nHistorically, many of the troops in Napoleon’s Italian army were Polish emigrants, who looked to Revolutionary France for sanctuary and inspiration after the third partition of Poland in 1795. The Polish legions were assembled by Jan Henryk Dabrowski acting for the Cisalpline Republic, a French puppet state. Eventually they became part of the army of the Republic of Lombardy. All, however, were under the command of Bonaparte. Napoleon made his name during his Italian campaign, thanks to his appeal to the common soldiers and brilliant strategies. He had the respect and admiration of his men and even managed to inspire the Army of Italy in 1796, despite the fact that they were under-equipped, underfed and unpaid!	false

Grenadier Guards have the ability to inspire their fellow soldiers just by their presence. They are incredibly disciplined and can reload their weapons with breathtaking speed and discharge them with high accuracy. Their extensive training makes them more expensive than line infantry.\\n\\nThe Grenadier Guards have a prestigious history that dates back to the time of Oliver Cromwell and the exile of King Charles II. Charles gathered troops around him in the hope of reclaiming his throne; one of the first of these units was Lord Wentworth’s Regiment of guards. These men remained in France following Charles’ restoration to the English throne, and another regiment was created to protect him, John Russell’s Regiment. Russell’s and Wentworth’s were eventually combined and became known as the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards. Their renown reached a peak at the battle of Waterloo where they were renamed, by royal proclamation, to the 1st or Grenadier Regiment of Foot Guards, because it was believed they had repulsed the Napoleon’s Grenadiers of the Guard.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCulture2_opera_house_european	\\n\\nAn opera house is a sumptuous theatre for the performance of highly stylized musical plays. The self-important and the genuinely important often attend to be seen rather than for amusement, but the “lower orders” are often genuinely entertained and distracted from the difficulties of life. No expense is spared on making an opera house a grand venue. They rival many great palaces with the luxury of their fixtures and fittings, as the public areas for the audience are at least as important as what is happening on stage. Having a prestigious opera house will improve town wealth as it draws crowds from far and wide.\\n\\nIn the 18th Century opera was done in the Italian “serious” style, a musical form that influenced many non-Italian composers including Mozart. The plots were intentionally simple, based on Classical themes, usually tragic and often had a highly conservative bent – as befitted the tastes of the patrons paying for the music. Many are still performed today. One fashion that mercifully ended before the Napoleonic period was the use of castrati: young men gelded so that their voices did not break and remained in the soprano range.	false

technologies_long_description_military5_iron_plating	\\n\\nAs guns have grown in calibre and fire a variety of explosive shells, wooden warships have become increasingly vulnerable. Iron plates are the response, bolted to the thick timbers of a conventional wooden warship’s hull. The timbers are still part of the defences of the ship, helping to absorb the impact of any hits. The wrought iron plating is immensely thick and heavy, with a consequent effect on the handling qualities of any “iron-clad” vessel. Cast iron, being inherently brittle, is entirely useless as a protective device.\\n\\nHistorically, iron-plated ships were not “ironclads” in that they did not always have the entirely iron construction, armour plating, and steam propulsion that defined those vessels. Some wooden ships-of-the-line were skinned with iron plates, but it was not an entirely successful experiment. More successful were the floating batteries that carried iron plating as armour: these were shallow draft platforms that were intended to maximise firepower. All other considerations, such as sailing characteristics, were secondary. Used for bombardments or for defence in restricted waters, such batteries were formidable; at sea they were a menace to their crews.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_Prince_Hohenlohe	\\n\\nA general inspires his men to greater efforts by his presence, if he truly has the gift of command. He need only obey the 17th Century military dictum of “pay well, command well, hang well” to ensure that his troops know exactly what is expected of them. If he does more, then he will be a true prince of battles! Yet, a general is not a combat unit: it is his job to command, not bathe his sword in the blood of enemies.\\n\\nGeneral Louis Aloy Prince de Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein was a remarkable soldier. He served in the armies of the Palatinate, his father’s domain of Hohenlohe-Bartenstein, the Netherlands, Austria, and eventually France, but only after the fall of Napoleon. He commanded, with some distinction, a regiment of French princes who had been exiled after the Revolution. After what can only be described as an adventurous early career, he became an Austrian major-general, and was then promoted to Feldmarshallleutnant and governor of Galicia. Napoleon attempted to bribe him, with his father’s old lands, into service with the Confederation of the Rhine, a French puppet state, but he refused. He did, however, serve in the French army after the Bourbon restoration, and died a Marshal of France, thanks to his excellent record.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Art_Horse_6_lber	\\n\\nThe cannon used by horse artillery lack range and firepower compared to other artillery pieces. This is considered unimportant; speed is all! Horse artillery units can move guns to a firing position, deploy, and then remove themselves with some despatch. They can be where they are needed to support and attack or break an enemy advance. They are a tactical reserve that any general will welcome, or a means to exploit a weakness in the enemy line.\\n\\nHistorically, Frederick the Great of Prussia observed that even the smallest artillery piece could be enough to break enemy defensive formations, leaving them open to subsequent attacks by infantry. He concluded that speed and mobility, rather than simple weight of shot, was important. This observation lead him to order the development of a ‘galloper’ gun, and a six-pounder that could be dragged at the gallop. Frederick’s contribution to military tactics was acknowledged by Napoleon himself, who considered the king a master tactician.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Mounted_Inf_Russian_Mounted_Rifles	\\n\\nOrganised and equipped as light infantry with muskets and horses as mounts, these riflemen see themselves as an elite force. Chosen for initiative and intelligence, they fight without close supervision from their officers. Their uniforms set them apart in an age when soldiers dress like peacocks: they deliberately blend into the landscape, firing on the enemy from the safety of the undergrowth. If these men are forced into close combat they will suffer heavy losses, but their ability to fire both mounted and on foot makes up for this shortcoming.\\n\\nHistorically, the most famous riflemen, the British Greenjackets, carried infantry rifles designed by Ezekiel Baker. This muzzle-loading flintlock fired a small ball from a tightly rifled barrel to give superb accuracy, with accounts of riflemen holding targets for each other at more than a hundred paces! It was a slow business to load the piece properly and could take a minute or more to do properly, but the resulting shot was deadly over astonishing ranges. Baker even carefully supplied a long “sword bayonet” so that the overall length of his rifle plus bayonet matched that of a line infantryman’s bayonet-tipped musket.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Skirm_French_Voltiguers	\\n\\nSkirmishers fight two battles: one against the enemy’s skirmishers to prevent them from doing their worst, and the second to harass the main body of the enemy army. Voltigeurs are excellent shots, even with their smoothbore muskets, and can whittle down the numbers of enemies they face very quickly. They are also well trained in using every scrap of cover and every fold in the landscape to hide. This makes them hard to spot and worse, hard to kill.\\n\\nAt the start of the Napoleonic period, most armies thought of light troops as auxiliaries to the line infantry. Part of Napoleon’s genius lay in taking existing ideas and making them work really well: he got the proportions of light and line troops right for his armies, and made sure that his attacking columns were well supported by swarms of skirmishers, including voltigeurs. Originally, the name had come about because they were expected to jump onto enemy cavalry horses and attack the riders that way! This was nonsense, but the voltigeurs did prove excellent soldiers. They were also given additional tasks, such as aiding pontonniers in building bridges; they could not only work hard, but also fight effectively to defend the bridge if necessary.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_gold_mine_european	\\n\\nLit only by candles (which they must buy themselves) or lamps with naked flames, most miners are labouring in conditions that resemble hell on earth. In some mines firedamp (methane) is a constant risk thanks to the candles – an explosion can happen at any time. The risk of a slow death is there too: stone dust and poisonous minerals such as arsenic ruin a man as surely as any explosion. \\n\\nThere are also accidents. Miners are paid only for the valuable minerals that they extract, so there is little incentive to carry out much work for safety’s sake. Pit props may keep the roof from collapsing, but putting them in does not earn any payment – the miners may even be charged for the materials! And it is not just men who labour below ground. Women often pull carts from the working face to the surface. Children need less space and air than adults, and make ideal support workers, clearing tunnels and bringing food and water to the miners. In smaller seams, children are the perfect labourers.\\n\\nAll of this is secondary, however, to the business of making money, and mining can be a very profitable industry.	false

technologies_long_description_military1_conscription	\\n\\nThis provides an enormous pool of recruits, and makes the business of building an army much simpler and cheaper: if a thousand men are needed for a regiment, they can be found instantly! The negative consequences are that conscripted soldiers are not reliable or particularly well trained: they do not want to be in the army, learn how to use a gun, or be in a battle. They want to go home in one piece. They cannot be expected to hold to the same standards of discipline as volunteers or regular soldiers.\\n\\nRevolutionary France was the first nation to introduce conscription, with the "Jourdan Law" of 1798. All men aged 20-25 were liable for service, but there were many exceptions. Clergymen, some essential workers and public office holders did not have to report, and it was possible to pay someone else to go in your place. This last clause effectively made conscription fall heavily on the poor and peasant classes. Ironically, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, the man who created the system that saved Revolutionary France, had been forced out of the army because his moderate views made the Committee of Public Safety suspicious of his loyalties.	false
technologies_long_description_military2_auxiliary_replenishment	\\n\\nLocal Recruitment Initiatives allow auxiliary units to be brought back to strength with some rapidity. All armies require additional men to replace those who have died, injured or simply deserted. Younger troops may be less experienced than hardened veterans, but they make up for that with naïve enthusiasm for the cause. Battle is also a fine school in itself: those who can learn to soldier do so very rapidly when cannonballs are flying!\\n\\nThough the Portuguese army was a separate entity during the Peninsular War, it was largely commanded by British officers, used British tactics and equipment and was almost entirely reliant on British money. The Portuguese were, effectively, auxiliaries to the British, although they could be relied on to fight bravely and with no little skill. The British high command certainly regarded the Portuguese as being significantly more useful than the loyalist Spanish Army. While the Spanish rank and file were good soldiers, they were poorly officered and supplied even though the British poured in money and arms. The Spanish guerrilla bands, on the other hand, were seen as a vital part of the war effort.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tGuns3_small_arms_factory_european	\\n\\nBy consolidating weapon production into one government-controlled factory the cost of weapons is significantly lessened and the quality of pieces also improves. Unfortunately, the harsh working conditions of these factories leave the lower classes miserable and disgruntled about their lot in life.\\n\\nHistorically, the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield, London was built under the instruction of the British Board of Ordinance towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The factory was eventually completed in 1816, too late to be of any immediate use, and began production of rifles and muskets. Swords were not produced until 1823. The site chosen for the factory was next to the River Lee, as this gave power for the machines and a means of transport. The Enfield factory would go on to make some of the most famous weapons used by the British army, including the .303 Lee-Enfield Rifle, or SMLE, another standard infantry weapon that was in service for many decades.	false

They have proven themselves time and time again in battle and this shows no signs of changing. They excel in melee and the sheer size of the men makes their charge a terrifying sight for even the most experienced soldiers. Talented with a bayonet as well as a musket, they are vulnerable to artillery fire. They must also be wary of heavy cavalry who could take them in a flank.\\n\\nHistorically, Pavlovsk Grenadiers were instantly recognisable on the battlefield as they retained a more traditional uniform while other units modernised their dress. This was an honour, given to them by Tsar Alexander after their gallant efforts at the Battle of Friedland. They retained the mitre cap that all other infantry units had relinquished, setting them apart and making them one of the most distinctive units of the Napoleonic era. This recognition was well deserved, as their bravery became the stuff of legend. In 1813 they were honoured again when they became part of the Imperial Guard.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Special_Bomb_Ketch	\\n\\n All sailing ships rely on having their masts and sails in positions that give them a balanced and evenly weighted push from the wind. Bomb ketches are not handy sailing vessels, thanks to their compromised rigging and the weight of the mortar and its mounting. The design needs to keep the forward portion of the ship clear for firing the mortar.\\n\\nThe strength of a bomb is in its mortar. This can throw an explosive shell high into the air to plunge down on enemies. The fact that the shell is explosive rather than solid adds to its deadly qualities: men and structures are equally shredded by the arrival of a shell.\\n\\nDuty aboard a “bomb” was not an enviable posting, and there was a good reason why bomb ketches were named after volcanoes, fire-gods or fearsome ideas. They had a nasty tendency to explode, thanks to the shells that they carried; fire aboard a mortar was far more dangerous than aboard any other type of sailing ship, as the ammunition as well as the propellant powder could go up! Despite this, all navies found them a useful ship to have, and the original French design was soon copied by all the sea-going European powers.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_russia_winter_palace	\\n\\nIt did so magnificently. The location in St. Petersburg was part of Peter’s policy of opening up to western ideas, where they were suitable for Russia, and his adoption of western architecture, culture and technology. The Tsar wanted his Palace to be the centrepiece of a “Third Rome” on the River Neva, and a new Imperial seat of government for all the Russias. It was deliberately built to be a palace rather than a fortress like the Kremlin in Moscow, although the wide prospects and avenues of St. Petersburg certainly made it entirely defensible by musket-armed troops.\\n\\nThe Palace remained as the official home of the Tsars for the next two centuries. It continued to play an important part in Imperial affairs until the end of Tsarist Russia and beyond. The 1905 “Bloody Sunday” massacre of unarmed protestors publicly demonstrated that the Tsar, for all the propaganda about being the “Little Father” of his people, had scant regard for the needs of ordinary folk. The storming of the Winter Palace in 1917 is an iconic moment in Russian history, the defining moment in the establishment of the Soviet state.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Guerilla_Mounted_Cazadores	\\n\\nThese men harass the enemy and, if possible, pick off important men in the enemy ranks. Unlike their comrades in the line and light infantry, they are mounted and can fight on foot if needed. They form up in a loose skirmish line, firing independently at their self-designated targets. The result is a constant barrage rather than a devastating volley, but a deadly one as officers and sergeants are removed from the fight.\\n\\nHistorically, Cazadores were trained to defend the border between Spain and Portugal, an area of much activity before and during the Peninsular War. In 1800, Napoleon and his Spanish ally, Manuel de Gordoy, demanded that Portugal ally with France. This was something that Portugal, a long-standing ally of the British, refused to do. In 1801 French and Spanish troops under Gordoy took the Portuguese town of Olivenza. Once the fighting was over, Gordoy picked oranges from a nearby grove and sent them back to the Queen to inform her of his victory, giving the affair the title of “The War of the Oranges”.	false

technologies_long_description_economy1_poverty_control_laws	\\n\\nIn order to properly aid and control the poor, a distinction must be made between the genuinely needy and the merely bone-idle and feckless. These vagrants prey on hand-outs meant for deserving locals, but suitable persuasion, such as a sound beating or prison, moves them on. Such strictures will also illustrate the advantages of honest work and act as a deterrent to anyone else looking to evade their duty of work. The feckless, being made to work, can add to the productivity of a region.\\n\\nHistorically, in many countries poor relief was closely regulated: the poor were “impotent”, ”able-bodied”, or ”idle”. Local government, being sensitive to local needs, distinguished between each type, and also decided on who needed moving on to another locale. Whereas the infirm and elderly could not earn a living wage, there were some who were happy to leech off the goodwill of charitable parishes. For the ”able-bodied” who couldn’t find work, there was also the workhouse. These institutions were made deliberately unpleasant to discourage the poor from viewing them as an easy alternative to finding work for themselves.	false

technologies_long_description_military5_percussion_cap	\\n\\nA flintlock makes a spark in an open pan; this then igniting the gunpowder to fire a musket. A percussion lock uses tiny amounts of chemicals called fulminates to create the spark needed. Fulminates explode when hit; there is no flint to come loose and no powder to become soaked in the rain. Instead a small copper cap is fitted onto the end of a tube that leads into the gun barrel; when struck by the lock’s hammer, the gun fires, even in damp weather.\\n\\nThe percussion cap was the invention of a Scottish clergyman, Alexander John Forsyth (1769-1843), who was looking for a solution to a hunting problem. The flintlock’s “flash in the pan” before the main charge fired alerted birds that they were about to be shot, causing them to fly away in a deucedly unsporting fashion. His clever idea to use a small ignition charge of fulminate of mercury gave him an invisible spark that didn’t warn his feathered targets!	false

Unlike many generals who have bought commissions, he has earned his position through success, not politics. As a result, his men would follow him into the mouth of Hell. His presence alone will make it harder to rout his troops: their faith in him really is that strong. For this reason, he should be kept out of the front line. Although he is armed with a sword his strength is leadership, and his death would be a great blow to the troops.\\n\\nMikhail Kutziv or Kutuzov (1745-1813) was a Field Marshal famed for defeating the French Grand Armée during Napoleon’s ill-fated invasion of Russia in 1812. By this time, Kutuzov had lost an eye in service, giving him a menacing countenance, and had achieved great honour during the Russo-Turkish Wars. He was a follower of the great Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov (1729-1800), something that certainly gave him the necessary military skills.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_timber_logging_camp_european	\\n\\nApart from its obvious uses in construction and as fuel, timber is vital for shipbuilding. All vessels of the period are entirely wooden, and need hundreds of tons of good quality timber, of many kinds, each. Frames and structural members, for example, are made of oak. Buildings also use large amounts of wood both in the structure and during the building process as scaffolding.\\n\\nHistorically, the forests of the eastern seaboard of America were an extremely useful strategic resource, as they became an excellent source of the trees needed for masts and yards for the British Royal Navy. By their nature, masts need tall trees! Other types of timber became important cash crops, such as the mahogany found in the Far East, prized for its strength and beauty.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tSecret1_gentlemens_club_middle_east	\\n\\nThe lure of the coffee house is the hustle and bustle of the place, the gossip that can be overheard, and the business that can be done there. It is the perfect place to meet, well, anyone, for any dark, nefarious, and unpleasant purpose, and all disguised by the perfectly innocent practice of taking a dish of coffee.\\n\\nCoffee was used first as a stimulant and a digestive in the Islamic world, reserved for mosque officials and medical men. The wonder of a drink that could keep a man awake all night so that he could observe the Moon properly and thereby keep the calendar properly ordered was a blessing indeed. Originally, coffee berries were used in the Yemen to make a kind of tea, but someone, somewhere accidentally stumbled across the idea of roasting the beans to make coffee as we would recognise it today. The brew, made by repeatedly boiling ground beans, was very close to what is now thought of as Turkish coffee, and must have been a welcome stimulant for everyone who tried it. After reaching Constantinople, the coffee habit took a further century before it reached Christian Europe: the first coffee house in Venice was opened in 1645.	false

message_event_text_text_revolution_monarchy_royalist_1	The ruling class' dissatisfaction with your current ruler has reached boiling point, and civil war has broken out in your home region. Although control of the capital city has been maintained, powerful nobles have formed a rebel army and aim to replace the monarch with a candidate of their choosing. To make matters worse, the army is split on this issue and treacherous elements within it have sided with the rebels, leaving the country in chaos. Do you wish to defend the monarch and crush the rebel army, or take control of the rebels and attempt to storm the capital?\\n\\n	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Stand_Portuguese_Cavalry	\\n\\nPortuguese horses, although hardy and reliable, are neither large nor fast enough to be used for heavy or light cavalry. For this reason, they are used as mounts in a kind of all-purpose cavalry, slower than light cavalry and weaker than most heavy cavalry units. Despite this lack of specialisation, they are still useful on the battlefield and fight courageously. They must be deployed with a little care, as charging them into well-trained line infantry squares will only lead to heavy losses.\\n\\nHistorically, cavalry regiments were the weakest arm of the Portuguese forces. They had difficulty raising effective cavalry due to Portugal’s lack of natural resources required to produce remounts. It was hard to find enough forage to sustain the horses, and the native animals were not large, or swift. As a result, Portuguese cavalry was never organised as specialised regiments and failed to fulfil the needed tactical roles. To be fair, Portugal simply did not have the spare land required for large herds of horses.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Elite_French_Dutch_Grenadiers	\\n\\nDutch Grenadiers see themselves as elite soldiers and occupy the place of honour at the right of the line on parade. This sense of inherent worth helps to inspire other soldiers and instils a sense of pride in the troops. They are incredibly disciplined and can reload their weapons at breathtaking speed, discharging them with relatively good accuracy. Their extensive training makes them more expensive to raise than other infantry units but, like all foot soldiers, they must exercise sensible caution when facing heavy cavalry and skirmishers.\\n\\nThe Dutch Grenadiers became part of Napoleon’s army following his 1810 annexation of Holland. At that time they were the Dutch Royal Grenadiers, and the men of this regiment entered Paris in August of 1810. Napoleon reviewed the troops personally and was very impressed by the fine appearance of the men. They wore white coats faced with crimson, instead of the traditional dark blue worn by other senior regiments (later other units wore white, but this was because the British blockade affected dye supplies). The Guard Grenadiers were not as impressed however, and the first meeting of these two regiments ended in a near-riot. Their behaviour was so appalling that they were forced to apologise to the general public for their rowdy and drunken antics.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Austrian_1st_Emperors_Own	\\n\\nThe 1st Regiment “Emperor’s Own” is made up of battle-hardened Czech troops, as deadly with their bayonets as they are excellent marksmen. They are best employed in an advance upon the enemy firing volleys before delivering a decisive bayonet charge. To guard against potentially devastating cavalry charges, they can form square, although this leaves them vulnerable to fire from artillery.\\n\\nHistorically, the Austrian army suffered thanks to the conservative mindset of its military establishment. Rules were handed down to the army from the Hofkriegsrat, the military-civilian administration. At a time when most nations were modernising, choosing less formal formations and making use of light infantry, the dead hand of bureaucracy meant that the Austrian Army could not adapt. Reforms were called for after each defeat, but were thwarted by financial issues. Despite the ineptitude and penny-pinching of national command, the ordinary Austrian soldiers fought on to acquit themselves with bravery and discipline: a surprisingly modern-looking problem for an army of 200 years ago.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_sweden_slott	\\n\\nBuilt on the site of an older fortress called the Three Crowns, the current Palace is actually its second incarnation as the first building was destroyed in fire in 1697. The current version was designed by Count Nicodemus Tessin (the Younger), an able Baroque architect and city planner, and took the best part of 50 years to complete in brick and sandstone. Much of the surrounding city was also re-laid as moats and the like were filled in.\\n\\nThe Palace is still in use as the official residence of the Swedish monarchy, and houses significant museum collections, including the Livrustkammaren, or Royal Armoury within its 609 rooms. This is the oldest museum in Sweden, established by the great Gustavus Adolphus in 1628 when he decided to keep and display his equipment from his Polish campaigns. The various departments of the royal court and household are also still based in the palace, as are the Högvakten, the Royal Guard of the Svea Livgarde (Lifeguards), who have been a part of Palace life since the 1750s.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_sweden_konglig_museum	\\n\\nThe Royal Museum was founded in 1792 by King Gustav III, and gave a home to his exquisite artwork collection. It now forms the core of the Swedish Nationalmuseum. \\n\\nGustav was an absolutist, as might be expected of a nephew of Frederick the Great of Prussia. He objected to parliamentary reforms, sought to distract everyone’s attention with an unsuccessful war against Russia and ignored public opinion. Although he was a playwright and a patron of music, the arts and sciences, and spent liberally on all of them, he did so without gaining much popularity among the people or nobles. His museum was the result of his free spending ways: where art was concerned, he was rather liberal with his money.\\n\\nIn the end, Gustav was assassinated by a conspiracy of noblemen at the Royal Opera House, an event that itself was turned into an opera by Giuseppe Verdi, Un ballo in maschera (The Masked Ball). Verdi had to change many of the details due to government censorship, as the assassination of a monarch was felt to be a bit too controversial in Italy of the 1850s.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_timber_lumber_mill_european	\\n\\nIt is more efficient to ship half-finished planks and logs than tree trunks, thus increasing the profits from logging. Even though most of the equipment used is brought in from home, a lumber mill on a good site can easily repay the investment. The hard work needed to dig a mill pond and race, as well as carefully position a waterwheel is also handsomely repaid when a powered saw starts work.\\n\\nHistorically, it was possible for a logging operation to denude a forest of all of its profitable trees, in the process causing terrible environmental damage. Without the trees, the soil is soon gone, washed away in the first strong rains. It then becomes almost impossible for any kind of forest to re-establish itself. This worried hardly anyone in the 18th Century (there were exceptions – some men did go out of their way to plant trees so that navies would never be without supplies), as the world had been given to men to subdue, and there were always more trees in the next valley.	false

technologies_long_description_military3_carcass_shot	\\n\\nThe shells are made by pouring an unpleasant cocktail of turpentine, tallow, resin, saltpetre, and sulphur and antimony compounds into a canvas sack, which is supported by iron interlocking hoops. The mixture hardens, and the shot can then be fired from mortars and howitzers. A weapon with a low muzzle velocity is required, otherwise the canvas rips apart and the crew are showered with the burning contents of the carcass. The hoops hopefully prevent the shot from bursting as it leaves the barrel, setting the users on fire rather than the target.\\n\\nIn theory, the mixture should burn for a few minutes when the shot bursts on impact, and be incredibly difficult to extinguish. Certainly, dousing the flames with water will have little effect. This makes carcass shot particularly useful against defensive positions, and an extremely unpleasant weapon when used against troops in the open.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Guerilla_Standard_Cavalry	\\n\\nArmed with a traditional straight sword, as opposed to the ever-popular sabre, these cavalrymen are a multipurpose unit. They are light enough to chase down a routing enemy, but heavy enough to charge effectively into enemy lines. However, their versatility comes at the cost of specialisation: should they be pitted against the likes of horse guards, their lack of specialist training will become apparent. \\n\\nSpain and the Peninsular War proved to be a major part in the downfall of Napoleon and this was thanks, in part, to his older brother Joseph. Joseph helped his brother to take control of France during the revolution and was rewarded with the throne of Naples in 1806. His time as king was brief, and he was soon sent elsewhere when Spain fell under Napoleon’s control. Napoleon needed someone he could trust on the Spanish throne and Joseph was the obvious choice. However, French occupation of Spain was unpopular to say the least and Joseph never really managed to gain a steady grip on the country. French control was eventually broken at the Battle of Vitoria and Joseph abdicated, fleeing back to France.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_star_fort_european	\\n\\nIn the Medieval period, castles had relied on high walls to make them impregnable and to give them a sense of overwhelming grandeur – part of their purpose was simply to intimidate lesser men. With the advent of gunpowder artillery, a different defensive scheme was required. Fortifications sank into the ground, protected by enormously thick walls, deep counterscarps and a sloping bank or glacis that would, hopefully, cause cannon shots to ricochet over the defences rather than penetrate.\\n\\nPassive defence, however, is not enough. The layout of projecting bastions in a star fort creates interlocking fields of flanking fire to destroy attackers as they approach over the sloping glacis. In theory, no attacker should reach the wall without coming under sustained and murderous attack from the defenders. The star shape evolved so that no part of the defences would be “blind” to fire from somewhere within the fort. The whole structure is, in fact, one massive killing zone for artillery weapons and defensive musketry. \\n\\nHistorically, the most notable creator of star forts was the French military engineering genius, Marshall Vauban (1633-1707); his name is virtually synonymous with the design. His defences at Verdun were still in use during the battle there in 1916 during the First World War.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_britain_british_museum	\\n\\nMany 18th Century gentleman collectors exhibited a “cabinet of curiosities” to friends and rivals. Competition for the most noteworthy and prestigious items soon meant that “cabinets” were often whole rooms or suites set aside for this expensive hobby. Studying the curiosities themselves also became a respectable field of scholarly endeavour by antiquarians, a strange collection themselves of dusty, rum coves with limited social skills.\\n\\nThe British Museum began as one of these collections, but George II donated the Old Royal Library, thus guaranteeing that every book ever published in Britain would end up on its library shelves. Further equally generous gifts, such as Garrick’s library of plays, and shrewd purchases made sure that the collection of antiquities grew at a prodigious rate. Sir William Hamilton (the husband of Emma Hamilton, the mistress of Admiral Horatio Nelson) profited quite handsomely when he sold his collection of Roman and Greek items to the Museum. He had collected them, as a hobby, for next to nothing while the ambassador in Naples, Italy. It probably took his mind off being cuckolded.\\n\\nThe Museum also became home to spoils of exploration and conquest: objects collected during Captain Cook’s expedition to the South Seas were exhibited at the museum for a time. The Rosetta stone also ended up in the Museum, having been captured from the French after Napoleon’s abortive attempt to conquer Egypt.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Special_Rocket_Ship	\\n\\nThe ship is entirely given over to the business of launch ramps and rocket stands. Given that rockets are horribly inaccurate, the most effective way of using them is to fire a great many at a single target all at once. Such a peppering with rockets, some of which may still be burning, can cause a target to catch fire or even explode. There is also a risk of explosion aboard the rocket ship and, because of this inherent danger, most navies see little point in using good quality hulls to mount rockets. There is little need to reinforce the fabric of the ship, because the rockets do not create much recoil, but rigging chains (not ropes) and wetted sails are standard to reduce the risk of fire.\\n\\nMilitary rockets in Europe were the result of some very nasty surprises suffered by European troops in India, where rockets had long been used in warfare. In Britain, Congreve’s rockets were direct copies of Indian weapons although this made them no less fearsome. Rockets were made with all kinds of warheads from simple spears to explosive shells; proposals were even put forward for a variety of war gasses and chemicals, although these were rejected as barbarous and un-Christian by every government. On ships, explosive heads were preferred, as these did the most damage to wooden targets.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_small_arms_factory_european	\\n\\nCentralising the provision of weapons is a sensible thing to do when raising large armies: equipping recruits with standardised items standardises weapons drill and unit tactics, and makes supply issues easier to manage. It also cuts down on the chances of manufacturers supplying shoddy or downright dangerous firearms, something that is always a temptation for profit-minded contractors.\\n\\nA small arms factory does not replace private arms manufacturers. While the soldiers make do with government-made weapons, it is usual for officers to purchase their own equipment. Many craft-based armaments firms can thrive by making bespoke items for wealthy gentlemen.\\n\\nHistorically, the French Charville and British “Brown Bess Land Pattern” muskets were outstandingly successful designs, and remained in service for over a century each, with minor modifications. This standardisation was a major step forward in tactical and, more importantly, logistical terms. Armies could no longer entirely live off the land; ammunition and powder had to be made and sent to the troops. With standard designs, it also became possible to “cannibalise” damaged weapons for spare parts, something that was impossible if weapons were locally bought by individual regiments.	false

technologies_long_description_military4_quicklime	\\n\\nQuicklime is a dangerous, caustic product that gets very, very hot when it is slaked with water. It does have entirely innocent uses: plaster, mortar and whitewash for buildings, and in glass making; but as a weapon it is frightening indeed. The smallest amount will cause painful, even fatal, burns on exposed flesh. The eyes are especially vulnerable because they are moist with tears. Quicklime shells carry an explosive charge so as to burst above enemy lines, but they are still dangerous to the gunners using them.\\n\\nHistorically, quicklime had a long history of use in warfare, dating back to Classical antiquity. This did not make it an acceptable weapon in the eyes of many military gentlemen who, quite rightly, realised that what could be used against the enemy could also be used against them. Further, like all chemical weapons, it was entirely dependent on the wind to send the caustic agent in the right direction once released. It was true that, short of running away, there was no practical defence against perfidious and odious chemical weapons.	false

Be it past victories, advances in education and technology, or a collection of treasures, such structures provide a stage to display achievements to the world. National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\\n\\nThe Heldenplatz, or Heroes Square, in Vienna faces the famous Hofburg Imperial Palace, the seat of the Hapsburg dynasty who ruled Austria. The palace itself was originally a fortified castle and the Heldenplatz was added to the front of this ancient structure during the reign of Emperor Francis Joseph. It was intended to be the centre piece of the new Kaiserforum, a complex that was never completed.	false

Some tactical skills are taught as well, but engineers are not usually expected to command armies and issue orders to gentlemen of quality. However, this hard-won knowledge helps create better officers and improves the recruitment of military units.\\n\\nSappers and miners, like artillery experts, had a long history of being permanent retainers in royal armies of the medieval and Renaissance periods. Thanks to the likes of the French Marshal Vauban (1633-1707) and his magnificent fortifications, the need for military engineers to create, or break into, defences grew, not lessened, during the 18th Century. The elaborate and layered defences that he and his successors developed required skilled architects and builders. Engineer officers became a corps of highly educated experts, while leaving the hard, mucky work of digging to the rank-and-file sappers and common pioneers!	false

events_event_text_embargo_act_repealed	The United States government introduced the Embargo Act in 1807 following several unprovoked acts of aggression by the Royal Navy towards American shipping. The act prevented vessels from docking at foreign ports without the permission of the President himself, and required ship captains to sign a bond guaranteeing compliance at the risk of the value of both the ship and its cargo.\\n\\nPresident Jefferson thought that this measure would prevent the United States from being drawn into war with Napoleon by the British due to their trade relationship with France. Unsurprisingly, the legislation was highly unpopular and almost impossible to enforce. It also proved unprofitable, as British ships continued to trade at American ports, damaging the US economy.\\n\\nFollowing much flouting of the act, and the resultant tightening of the rules surrounding it, the Embargo Act has finally been repealed – the President declaring the United States “safe enough” from entering the conflict.	false

At last, America is the Land of the Free, as well as the Home of the Brave. The remaining British troops leave American shores by the shipload and American independence has been fully, if reluctantly, accepted in London.\\n\\nWithout your efforts, none of this would have been possible. America would remain in the hands of the British. Your careful planning and well-timed aggression have brought Americans to a new dawn. The dark night of British rule is at an end. The bright dawn of a united America lies ahead.	false

As word of the successful colonisation of the New World spreads, more people arrive from the Old World. Other European nations have taken note of your success.

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Russian_Lifeguard_Horse	\\n\\nThe Lifeguard Horse troops are members of Russia’s Imperial Guard. They are a terrifying sight to behold on the battlefield. In close combat, they wield straight heavy cavalry swords and the armour they wear provides them with protection against enemy blows. Their horses are slow, but very strong, and they use them to batter and intimidate enemy infantry with powerful cavalry charges.\\n\\nIn 1800, army reforms split the Tsar’s Lifeguard cavalry into several different regiments: the Horse Guards, Lifeguard Hussars, Lifeguard Cossacks and, most senior of all, the Chevalier-Garde. The Lifeguard first saw action against Napoleon in the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, but were driven back by cavalry of Napoleon’s own Imperial Guard. It was Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz that effectively destroyed the Third Coalition against France and thereby altered European politics.	false

An artillery fort therefore requires a lot of timber for bracing, and a considerable amount of manual work to create the required earthworks. These do make the structure better able to resist bombardment by attackers, but no timber structure, even one backed by earthen banks, can stand forever against artillery. A wooden artillery fort commands the surrounding landscape, and is a significant strategic obstacle to any invading force.

Gone are the days when master craftsmen could take pride in their efforts; instead, men tend machines, or do a single task over and over again.\\n\\nA “manufactory” was distinguished from a “factory” because goods of some kind were made there, rather than being traded. Every type of item that could be made was eventually turned out by a manufactory somewhere: pottery, cloth, iron, weapons, and so forth. With better transport by canal and river, it also became possible for towns to specialise in the making of a single type of product: Nottingham in England produced enormous quantities of lace, while Northampton, a little to the south, became a centre of shoe manufacture. Wherever coal could be easily mined, there appeared great mills and filthy towns of workers' slums.	false

technologies_long_description_military2_mass_mobilisation	\\n\\nMass mobilisation is the social and political theory that claims that the general public can be inspired to fight for a country or for nebulous ideals such as “freedom”. When men go willingly to war they can be persuaded to suffer hardships beyond those of regular soldiering: overcoming a lack of supplies, food and arms are part of the struggle. Belief is a powerful tool in battle: men will stand for an idea, even in the face of death. Mobilisation reduces the recruitment costs for militia units.\\n\\n Historically, the French Revolution was the first example of mass mobilisation, even if it was not referred to as such at the time. The people were harnessed to the ideals of the revolution, and willing to undergo hardships in its name. As these ideals were threatened by foreign monarchies, the people could be easily roused to defend them. Patriotic and revolutionary fervour was encouraged by the government to great practical effect; by 1799 more than one million men had shown themselves willing to fight for France and the Revolution.	false

They use European tactics and drill, but still retain a distinctly Ottoman Turkish taste, and flare, for battle. They are equipped with muskets and bayonets, allowing them to fire volleys and then attack in close combat. They can form square to counter cavalry attacks, but are vulnerable to artillery fire when they do so.\\n\\nSultan Selim III created the Nizam-I Cedit in 1794, an army trained in the Western style, and one that was intended to replace the feudal and janissary troops found in Ottoman armies. The old-style army had been beaten when it faced the Russians, and Selim saw that change was needed. The Nizam-I Cedit proved successful, and a second orta was organised as a mounted militia, recruited from ethnic Turkish peasants. Further expansion of the idea came to naught, as Selim was removed, violently, by a janissary revolt motivated by their resentment of change.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_Abdullah_Pasha	\\n\\nA general inspires his men to greater efforts by his presence, if he truly has the gift of command. He need only obey the 17th Century military dictum of “pay well, command well, hang well” to ensure that his troops know exactly what is expected of them. Although it might be tempting to throw a general and his bodyguards into combat to shore up a weak position, or break through in a critical part of the line, this is a waste. A general is not a combat unit: it is his job to command, not bathe his sword in the blood of enemies.\\n\\nNo Ottoman commander gained his position by being overly concerned about the welfare of his men. Any who showed weakness would have been removed, if not by the sultan then by the fanatically conservative ultra-loyalists of the janissary corps. Other than protecting their own privileges and perquisites, the janissaries were also very protective of the state and its dignity. Of course, a commander who was too successful and threatened the janissaries’ hold on power by possibly taking it away would also have to be cautious of his personal safety.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Guerrilla_Husares	\\n\\nThe essence of the guerrilla or “little war” is that a small force can take on a much larger foe by relying on ambushes, cunning and speed. Guerrilla Húsares are motivated by their hatred for the French, which drives them forward during their impressive cavalry charges. Their speed and agility should be used to chase down skirmishers or disrupt enemy artillery, but they will be outclassed should they ever face heavier cavalry in melee or, for that matter, infantry in square.\\n\\nThe mountainous terrain of Spain and Portugal made movement by heavy cavalry or artillery slow and difficult for all the armies in the Peninsular War. The roads that did exist were rough and poorly maintained, prompting the Grand Armée and the Spanish guerrillas to rely on lighter cavalry such as hussars as the mobile elements. Many of the guerrillas were actually from the towns and villages found high in the mountains. Their local knowledge gave them an advantage in covering ground. Their reputation as mountain “savages” was as useful as numbers in intimidating the French; it was a notoriety enhanced by the collecting French ears and fingers as war trophies.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Art_Foot_French_Artillerie_a_Pied	\\n\\nThis elite unit is precise and deadly, but it does have the disadvantage of being vulnerable to fast moving cavalry and melee attacks. The soldiers who man these guns, although armed with swords, are not trained to defend themselves effectively. The power here lies in the cannons, and placing them at a discreet distance from the fray is always advisable.\\n\\nFormed in 1808, the Artillerie à Pied consisted of six companies of gunners and a company of ouvriers-pontonniers. These ouvriers-pontonniers were responsible for building bridges, allowing the artillery to pass swiftly and safely to their positions. There was some argument amongst the engineers and the artillery over who had command of these men but it was eventually decided that they should be assigned to the artillery. Ouvriers-pontonniers could construct a bridge of sixty to eighty pontoons, some 500 feet or 150 metres long, in just seven hours. They were also known to improvise if supplies were short, creating bridges from any materials that were to hand.	false

technologies_long_description_admin1_classical_economics	\\n\\nClassical economics seeks to change the way a nation’s wealth is considered. No longer is the amount of money in a king’s treasury the sole measurement of national wealth. The earnings of the populace are now taken into account. With this step forward people leave feudal society and step forward as individuals seeking their own gains for their own benefit.\\n\\nClassical economics was eventually superseded. Its influence does still linger however, especially within the modern school of thought known as “new classical economics.”\\n\\nHistorically, the school of classical economics was originally created by Scottish philosopher Adam Smith, but David Ricardo is leading the school forward in its beliefs and methods. His debates on such topics as the Corn Laws with Thomas Malthus are giving theorists much to consider. One of the key questions the theory seeks to answer is: how can a society be built upon a system where man seeks to further only his own interests	false

building_description_texts_long_description_pTrade2_commercial_port_european	\\n\\nA commercial basin opens up new opportunities for trade, as agents now put together cargoes and charter vessels for merchants who would otherwise be unable to trade. This significantly improves not only the town’s wealth, but the entire region's and opens up a number of new sea trade routes that had previously been inaccessible. This commercial advance does have one disadvantage however, the lower classes resent their harsh working conditions and their happiness is affected.\\n\\nThe infamous triangle of trade between Bristol and Liverpool, in England, and Africa was a staggeringly profitable business. Manufactured goods, guns, cloth and trinkets went to Africa, where they were traded to the local warlords. Slaves, carried in horrendous conditions, made up the cargo for the middle run, across the Atlantic. In the Caribbean and America, the survivors were sold, and the ships loaded with sugar and rum bound for Britain. There was a handsome profit in each stage. The moral foulness of the trade, however, eventually trumped its profitability and, in 1807, the abolitionists finally succeeded in having the slave trade banned throughout the British Empire. Existing slaves, however, were not freed in British territories until 1833.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Art_Fix_Ottoman_Bombardment_Mortars	\\n\\nTo the uneducated eye, a mortar looks like a large, stumpy cooking pot, set at an angle in a heavy wooden frame. Indeed, the weapon’s name may even come from its similarity to the mortars used to grind spices. Mortars use indirect fire, firing their percussive shells and quicklime high into the air to plunge down on enemy positions.\\n\\nUnlike a howitzer, a mortar uses a fixed, and relatively small, charge of gunpowder to propel its shell. Range is adjusted by changing the angle of fire; accuracy is subject to winds and weather. There is also a practical minimum range to mortar fire as the weapon cannot be aimed in a near-vertical position. The men that handle them are incredibly vulnerable to fast moving cavalry.\\n\\nModern mortars owe their widespread use to trench warfare in the First World War. Current designs, based on the British Stokes trench mortar, come in many sizes. Most can fire shells with proximity fuses as anti-personnel rounds. The larger examples can fire sophisticated “smart” munitions that guide themselves onto targets.	false

technologies_long_description_economy2_plateways	\\n\\nWith industry comes the demand for materials and fuels to sustain it, and the need for improved transport to carry them. One answer lies in putting carts on cast iron channels called plateways, laid out as tracks that guide the vehicles. These sturdy plateways are laid on level routes as far as possible, allowing horses to pull heavy loads for great distances. Plateways make mining and industry more efficient by delivering bulk raw materials.\\n\\nHistorically, movement of iron ore and coal without using rivers or canals was costly and slow. Horse-drawn wagons ran along wooden rails, but these regularly broke under the strain. Cast iron provided the answer in the form of L-shaped iron rails; the upright guided the cart wheels. This system worked well enough, but the carts were easily derailed by stones. This was not an uncommon problem when iron ore and other stony products were being carried. The weight of carts could also crack the cast iron used. Both these problems were solved by the introduction of wrought iron rails, but the concept of a plateway is a direct ancestor of the modern rail network.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Art_Foot_12_lber	\\n\\nDespite the name, foot artillery batteries are towed by horses. The artillerymen, however, march alongside their pieces rather than ride. Because the guns can be loaded with round or canister shot they are effective at long and short range: canister shot turns cannons into gigantic fowling pieces. Artillery is slower than the rest of the army and, if left behind and undefended, will be vulnerable to cavalry attacks. Disabling the enemy’s guns should always be a high priority for a general, and artillerymen only have the most rudimentary sword skills for their defence.\\n\\nBy the late eighteenth century, improvements in artillery design had drastically reduced the weight of cannons and their field carriages. Design improvements had reduced the time to get into action from the march. By carefully positioning the barrel in the centre of the gun carriage, the balance, and manoeuvrability of guns was significantly improved. Napoleon was an artilleryman, and his use of guns in concentration against small parts of the enemy battle line persuaded many nations to increase the size of their own artillery corps.	false

It is not his place to spend a battle with a sword in his hand and blood in his eye!\\n\\nA famous pipe smoker and proponent of scientific investigation, Joseph Alvinczi’s military career was punctuated with acts of great personal bravery, something that made him incredibly popular with his men. He played a key role in gathering the Tyrolean militia who resisted Napoleon during his advance across Italy in 1796. He and his new recruits were sent to relieve Mantua and break Napoleon’s siege. At first successful, Alvinczi won a victories at Caldiero and Bassano. He was eventually defeated at Arcole, though he ignored his deteriorating personal health to regroup his men and launch a further attack at Rivoli.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_france_arc_de_triomphe	\\n\\nAll armies and nations need to mark their victories and honour their dead. The Arc de Triomphe was the largest structure of its type ever designed, and was intended to be a grandiloquent gesture of French military superiority. This, given that Napoleon Bonaparte had direction of the French army, was entirely reasonable.\\n\\nCreated to mark Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz in 1805, the structure was commissioned a year later, but not completed until the 1830s. Napoleon ordered a wooden mock-up to be put in place in 1810, and work was completely halted after the Bourbon restoration. Napoleon’s corpse eventually passed through the arch on its way to its final resting place at Les Invalides. This was not the only remarkable thing to pass through the arch: at the victory parade to mark the end of the First World War, a pilot flew his Nieuport biplane under the arch as part of the event! The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a later addition, commemorating the honoured dead and missing of the French army in the Great War.	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_Johann_Beaulieu	\\n\\nMorale is vital in battle. If one unit routs, another may panic and follow. This can be disastrous for any army, and the presence of a commander who can steady the men should never be underrated. The man who can rally his men, give them courage in the face of overwhelming odds, and still be clear-headed enough to take decisions that may kill them, in the cause of victory, is an indispensable asset. Such generals are more important than armies.\\n\\nJohann Beaulieu (1725-1819) was an intelligent and knowledgeable general. In his private life he was an art lover and collector and a follower of science. His taste for finer and intellectual things in life did not adversely affect his ability on the battlefield. Working his way up the ranks from cavalry officer to full general, he was renowned for being cool-headed, brave and wise. During the Battle of Lodi in 1796, he fought and lost against Napoleon, at the time a newly appointed general, but Beaulieu would not be the last to do that.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sAdmin2_magistrate_european	\\n\\nLaw, order, and taxes are the basis of government. A magistrate is the government embodied in one person: his duties mean that he can help collect taxes, repress the people, and take their sons into the army, all at the same time. He is an administrator, tax collector, thief-taker, instigator of charitable works, military recruiter and father figure.\\n\\nA magistrate usually represents the state and the landed classes, even in a republic. Liberty and equality are all very well, but the rich need to be sure their wealth is secure. Under Napoleon, magistrates in every district were carefully selected and monitored by a Ministry of Justice, and used to keep an eye on disloyalty to the new regime. Often, magistrates were sent to distant provinces, so that they had no local sympathies. In Britain, the opposite tended to be the case: magistrates were selected from among the local gentry, who knew their neighbours and tenants intimately. Magistrates also had the power to call out troops to put down any civil disturbances, and to send convicted men off to the military as punishment.	false

events_event_text_mutiny_vellore	The sons of Tippu Sultan, the former ruler of Mysore, recently instigated a rebellion of the Sepoys against the British East India Company at Vellore in southern India. Although lasting for only one day, the mutineers caused two hundred British casualties.\\n\\nDissent amongst the Sepoys has increased following changes to their dress code banning facial hair and Hindu markings, and reached dangerous levels since several Sepoys were brutally punished for flaunting the new rules. Under the pretext of attending the wedding of a daughter of the late Tippu Sultan, the plotters gathered at the fort in early July. In the dead of night the fort was surrounded and the mutineers began killing its European inhabitants. By dawn the fort was under their control and Fateh Hyder, the second son of Tippu Sultan, was declared King of Mysore.\\n\\nThe mutiny came to an end when, alerted by an escaped officer, the Madras Cavalry arrived from Arcot and gained access through the insufficiently secured gates at the front of the fort. What followed was a slaughter, with almost seven-hundred rebel casualties by the end of the day.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the mutiny the Governor of Madras was replaced, the East India Company no longer interfered with the religious customs of its soldiers, and the practice of flogging Sepoys was totally abolished.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sRoads3_tarmac_roads_european	\\n\\nThe road is actually constructed in layers of differently sized stones, starting with large rocks as the foundation, and layers of smaller stones on top. Each layer is compressed when it is laid with a heavy roller. The end result is a solid path that can drain cleanly, as there are always small gaps for rainwater to trickle through. This method is often used for the key strategic and commercial routes between cities and defence points. Tolls are often charged to users of such excellent roads and turnpikes, as they are often constructed for profit. Metalled roads in a region allow military forces to travel with great speed.\\n\\nTechnically, “metalled roads” do not require a tarmac surface to be termed “metalled”: a concrete surface is also a metalled road. Roads were only covered in “tarmac” after 1820, when the idea of using tar to stabilise the top layer of stones was tried by John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836). His idea was a success, although a “McAdamised” finish was not called “tarmac” until 1901!	false

technologies_long_description_military2_logistics	\\n\\nA supply system can aid in making sure that the attrition inevitably suffered by military units in hostile lands is reduced: soldiers who are properly supplied with all their necessaries are less likely to die or desert. The same system that can deliver a musket or a barrel of gunpowder to the front can also be used to send replacement soldiers forward as well.\\n\\nBefore gunpowder, armies could support themselves entirely by pillaging, even if this did ruin any land they crossed. This changed with the introduction of gunpowder, as it could rarely be stolen, and could not be manufactured on the march; a transportation system and supply dumps became absolutely vital.\\n\\nThe writings of Antoine-Henri Jomini, a Frenchman and eventually a Russian general officer, did much to advance the understanding of logistics, the art of military supply. His career included training to be a banker, and time working for an arms manufacturer, but his skills came to the fore when he was a secretary in the Swiss Ministry of War, in charge of reorganising the way the business of war was conducted. This gave him the grounding he needed for his organisational and supply work.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_unitedprovinces_teylers_museum	\\n\\nPieter Teyler van der Hulst (1702–1778) left his fortune to the furthering of science and culture, as befitted a part-Scottish follower of the Scottish Enlightenment. He also left money for some almshouses for the poor folk of Haarlem. Before his death he had established various learned societies in the town and, like many gentlemen of the period, had a “cabinet of curiosities”: a large collection of objects of interest or antiquarian value. His fortune, made from the cloth trade, was certainly large enough to let him indulge in his passions for science and collecting.\\n\\nThe museum was a reflection of his interests, and was added to over the years so that it now has a fine collection of fossils, scientific instruments (and making them was something of a Dutch speciality), coins, paintings, prints and drawings. Pieter Teyler left a charitable and worthy legacy of a “Christian gentleman” in the museum and the almshouses.	false
unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Russian_Musketeers	\\n\\nEven Russia’s foes have a grudging respect for these sons of the Motherland. They are capable of delivering a volley of devastating fire into an enemy with their smoothbore muskets, and then following it up with a good bayonet charge. They have good morale, but this is no protection against artillery bombardment or the sniping of skirmishers. If threatened by cavalry, they can form square.\\n\\nBarclay de Tolly, the Russian Minister of War in 1810, instigated a complete re-organisation of the Russian army, to bring it up to date with contemporary tactics. Before him, the army had suffered from the eccentricities of Tsar Paul I, who had reversed, ignored or subverted many of Catherine the Great’s policies. Paul chose to model his army on that of Frederick the Great, an organisation pattern already a quarter-century out of date when he chose it. Among the other madness that Paul inflicted on his poor soldiers was the introduction of steel knee plates; these were not for protection, but to make the soldiers adopt a “proper” stiff-legged marching style!	false

building_description_texts_long_description_prest_spain_academia	\\n\\nThe Academy received royal approval in 1744, but it was not until the reign of Carlos III that it found a proper home in a former Baroque palace. This is somewhat surprising given that Carlos was a benevolent despot and rather fond of hunting. He was, however, also much given to public works and, more significantly for the advancement of the arts, had had a serious falling out with the anti-Enlightenment Jesuits. He suppressed the order in Spain and rendered the Spanish Inquisition largely ineffective.\\n\\nThe Academy included many artists of note, but surely its most distinguished master was Francisco Goya (1746-1828). Goya was supremely talented, and became the painter of choice in the Spanish court. His work marks a transition between the work of the “Old Masters” and the modern world to come: his painting “La maja desnuda” has been described as the first non-symbolic nude painting in the Western world. Sadly, he was tortured by deafness and illness in later life, and his painting took on a grimmer, darker feel.\\n\\nThe Academy is now home to a fine collection of paintings from the 15th Century onwards.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Prussian_Musketeers	\\n\\nPrussian line infantry revel in the hand-to-hand struggle of a good bayonet charge. They are quite capable of delivering a volley of devastating fire into an enemy with their smoothbore muskets. They have good morale, a legacy of being indoctrinated in their nation’s past glories, but this is no protection against artillery bombardment or the sniping of skirmishers. If threatened by cavalry, they can form square.\\n\\nIn the years before 1806 the Prussian army had become a little complacent, confident that the glories of the Seven Years War meant that a Prussian soldier was unbeatable. There was no need to change an army that had performed so well. Iron discipline was considered enough to beat any foe. While the immaculately turned out and perfectly drilled Prussians were superficially impressive, they turned out to be inadequate when facing a tactical genius like Napoleon.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_tEducation3_enlightened_university_spain	\\n\\nEach turn, a modern university has a very good chance of producing a gentleman, and it also significantly aids technology research in the region. The liberal thinking that occurs greatly improves the region's happiness, but also creates a strong desire for reform among the people. National pride in intellectual achievement is an important motive in the all the studies undertaken, along with personal pride and ambition. Ideas, however, are not confined to the intellectual elite, but passed on to everyone who can understand: learning inspires artists, poets and musicians, and well-read laymen.\\n\\nThe French Revolution was not always kind to scientists. On the one hand, Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) did not suffer greatly and was not forced out of the country on account of his Italian birth; Napoleon later named him as one of the Légion d'honneur. On the other hand, Antoine Lavoisier (1743-94), a man rightly hailed as the father of modern chemistry was, in the space of a single day, tried, condemned, and executed on trumped-up charges. His involvement in tax farming possibly counted against him, but in killing Lavoisier, a political liberal as well as a genius, France lost one of the greatest minds of all time.	false

technologies_long_description_economy1_division_of_labour	\\n\\nAs a society develops, its capabilities and needs grow. By dividing work into tasks, and allocating these to specific workers, a manufactory owner can develop a more effective work force. As workers specialise in their tasks, they will become faster and find ways of improving their work; this knowledge can be passed on to future workers. This result is an increase of each building’s economic output.\\n\\nScottish philosopher Adam Smith (1723-90) was a champion of the division of labour. He argued that any rate of production would be dramatically increased within industry if work was divided effectively. In his book “The Wealth of Nations” he called for a public education system to be put in place to teach workers the fine points of their crafts, if not much else. American author and naturalist Henry David Thoreau (1817- 1862) later criticized this idea in his book “Walden”. Thoreau thought specialisation was at the expense of traditional skills, such as farming and house-building, which were needed for true independent living.	false

Their mounts are among the slowest horses used by cavalry, and are best employed in planned attacks rather than the role of reserve cavalry.\\n\\nHistorically, French Carabiniers had royalist roots but, unlike the other royal units, managed to escape abolition during the French Revolution, and instead found a place in France’s newly reorganised cavalry. Despite this, the carabiniers still had some royalist sympathies and frequently clashed with the Revolutionary authorities. When Napoleon came into power he showered them with “armes d’honneur” in order to gain their loyalty. It worked. After the carabiniers sustained casualties in 1809 against the Austrians, Napoleon revised their uniforms, giving them cuirasses and helmets.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_rHorse2_stud_farm_european	\\n\\nAdvances in animal husbandry allow horse breeders to become more selective about the traits they wish to cultivate, thus improving the military worth of their horses. With better breeding schemes the recruitment of cavalry units becomes significantly cheaper, as less effort has to be expended in finding good quality mounts. A stud farm also adds significantly to the agricultural wealth of a region.\\n\\nHistorically, the Tarbes Stud Farm near Lourdes in the Midi-Pyrénées region of France was one of the most famous of the Napoleonic era. Established in 1806, it was created to provide hussar regiments with horses. It took pure-bred horses from many sources, including the pure-blooded English, pure-blooded Arab, as favoured by Napoleon himself, along with French saddle, Merens, and Clydesdales from Brittany and Franche-Comté. The Anglo-Arab cross was first produced at Tarbes. The stud farm remains open to this day.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Militia_French_National_Guard	\\n\\nWhen considered against other militias, the National Guard is clearly a superior force. However, they should not be expected to stand against regular military units; they are an armed police force, intended to keep order. In battle, they lack confidence, and may run. They are, however, useful garrison troops, can maintain public order, and are inexpensive to recruit and pay.\\n\\nThe French National Guard was formed in 1789, a result of “la Grande Peur”, or the “Great Fear”. Failed harvests led to unrest and the National Assembly needed a police force. The Troupes Provinciales were unreliable because they were recruited, by lottery, from the peasantry who were the source of the unrest. The National Guard, on the other hand, attracted the middle classes to its ranks, if only because guardsmen were expected to pay for their own uniforms and equipment. That social difference made them a more reliable force.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sheep_peasant_farms_european	\\n\\nDay-to-day life for a peasant farmer has barely changed in a thousand years. It is a short, hard life of abject poverty and backbreaking labour. He can expect nothing better than to work and die in the same village, tilling the same fields, his life bounded by the same horizon. Peasant farms are not terribly efficient: the landowners have little interest in anything beyond their rents and tithes. The problem for them is that peasant economies are, by their very nature, cash poor and most income is in kind, and there is a limit to where you can spend a goat!\\n\\nHistorically, life for a peasant was pretty much the same all over the world: work from dawn to dusk. In Russia, the peasants were serfs tied to the land and the property of the landowner as much as any cow or goat. In India, peasants were a caste locked into their social position by hallowed custom. The system eventually broke down in Western Europe thanks to industrialization needing a constant supply of workers and changes in land usage.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_Russian_Lifeguard_Hussars	\\n\\nLifeguard Hussars are members of Russia’s Imperial Guard cavalry, and all are elite servicemen. Dressed in impressive uniforms and riding the fastest of horses, they enjoy a high status in the Russian army, and are supremely sure of their abilities, sometimes to the point of arrogance. They have excellent morale and speed, making them exceptional when charging, and ideal for chasing down skirmishers or attacking artillery units. However, they sacrifice some strength for speed and are vulnerable if pitted against heavier cavalry in melee or infantry units in square.\\n\\nCzar Paul I (1754-1801) formed his own personal guard cavalry in the Lifeguard Hussars, Chevalier-Garde, Horse Guards and Lifeguard Cossacks when he was crowned. These new bodyguards replaced the existing guard cavalry created by his mother, Catherine the Great (1729 -1796). Disgusted by what he saw as the decadence and corruption of the old nobility, Paul I devoted his reign to renewing the medieval notion of chivalry through a reorganisation of the Russian hierarchy. Unfortunately, Paul I’s long-held fear of assassination was justified: he was soon murdered by disgruntled members of the nobility.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_Michele_Colli	\\n\\nA general inspires his men to greater efforts by his presence, if he truly has the gift of command. He need only obey the 17th Century military dictum of “pay well, command well, hang well” to ensure that his troops know exactly what is expected of them. Although it might be tempting to throw a general and his bodyguards into combat to shore up a weak position, or break through in a critical part of the line, this is a waste. A general is not a combat unit: it is his job to command, not bathe his sword in the blood of enemies.\\n\\nMichelangelo-Colli Alessandro Marchini, to use his full name, was an Austrian Feldmarschal-Leutnant in Italy, who opposed with limited success, the advance of the French army. He was rather unfortunate to be facing a military genius Napoleon Bonaparte who, in 1796, had everything to prove on his first campaign. Colli was in charge of a Sardinian army, and was neatly separated from the Austria main force under General Beaulieu. He was later appointed to command the army of the Papal States, without any great success, and then he was attached to the Neapolitan army, under another Austrian commander, Karl Mack von Leiberich. Colli ended his days in Florence, as an Austrian ambassador.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Line_Ottoman_Beylik_Janissary_Musketeers	\\n\\nThe janissaries are the cream of the Ottoman army but, in comparison to some other national armies, they fight in an old-fashioned way. Their strict code values personal initiative and courage, making them fierce warriors when in close combat.  They are carry swords, and refuse to adopt bayonets, making them more vulnerable to cavalry charges than European troops.\\n\\nHistorically, the janissaries were the paid “new soldiers” of the sultan, rather than feudal levies. The corps grew so powerful they became a law unto themselves, able to make and break sultans as they saw fit. They were also deeply conservative in the outlook, and jealous of any threats to their position as the Ottomans’ best military force and its bureaucracy. This arrogance eventually lead to their downfall in what became known as the “Auspicious Incident”: Sultan Mahmud II goaded them into yet another revolt, then crushed them.	false

Light and fast, they can quickly reach areas of the battlefield where they are most needed, cutting down the enemy with their curved sabres. Their speed makes them especially effective against units such as artillery and skirmishers, as they can close before taking too much fire. Heavier cavalry units or line infantry in square will overmatch the Hussards, as their mounts are chosen for speed, not strength.\\n\\nThe 5e Regiment de Hussards has its roots in the Légion de Lauzun, which was formed in 1778 and saw action during the American War of Independence. The regiment earned itself a reputation for bravery and stoic resolve at the Battle of Yorktown where it chased down a unit of light horse commanded by the famous British commander Banastre Tarleton. The Légion de Lauzun was renamed in 1793 and became the 5e Regiment de Hussards, seeing service in several key battles of the Napoleonic Wars before eventually being disbanded in November 1815.	false

The layout of the gardens is intended to reflect the layout of paradise, and perfect blooms are a part of that.\\n\\nDespite the insane financial speculation of “tulip mania” in Holland during the 17th Century, the tulip was not a native plant; it had arrived from the Ottoman Empire. The Dutch, however, were quite innovative when they indulged in the lunacy of tulip speculation, trading individual bulbs at ridiculously inflated prices. They even operated a “tulip futures” market on specimens that hadn’t even been planted or grown! Dishonesty was rife and eventually the speculation had to stop; the tulip market collapsed, like all financial bubbles, leaving many penniless. The tulip, fortunately, remains a popular garden plant to this day, although thankfully without the financial jiggery-pokery! Gardeners with too much money did pay high prices for tulip bulbs in the 18th Century although these were for planting, not financial speculation.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Light_British_KGL_Light_Dragoons	\\n\\nFast moving and highly skilled, these light dragoons are a useful and versatile unit. Their true skill lies in horsemanship, although they need to dismount to use their carbines. Their flexibility in battle makes them ideal for use against artillery and skirmishers. However, should they find themselves facing well-disciplined line infantry in square their weaknesses will swiftly become apparent.\\n\\nHistorically, the dragoons and the light dragoons of the Kings German Legion were quartered in Weymouth, on south coast of England, along with two horse artillery batteries. The barracks were often visited by King George III and the men were his particular favourites. He would walk among the men as he oversaw drill, discussing news of home in Germany and joking with them. He even took to wearing the uniform of the dragoons during his visits. The practice of visiting the men of the Kings German Legion didn’t die with George III; the then-Prince of Wales and other members of the Royal family continued this tradition for years to come.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Small_Brig	\\n\\nIn the hands of a good master, a brig is a handy little ship, and can almost turn in its own length. The square-rigged sails allow precise control. A good helmsman can swiftly bob in and out of range of larger, deadlier ships whose cannons could demolish the brig’s weak hull. This manoeuvrability makes up for the light armament, which consists of only 6-pounder cannons, which have little real firepower in naval terms.\\n\\nHistorically, the United States Navy favoured brigs, particularly on the Great Lakes. Brigs, like the USS Argus, also gave a brave account of themselves against the Barbary Pirates along the North African coast. United States traders had suffered at the hands of the pirates after the Revolution; the Barbary Pirates had an agreement to leave British and British colonial ships alone, but after the successful rebellion, they considered the newly-flagged American ships to be fair game. Today, a brig is more commonly understood to be a ship’s prison cells, a usage that is probably due to the US Navy’s use of brigs as prison hulks.	false

A howitzer and cannon hybrid, the unicorn is operated by skilled artillerymen who, although expertly trained in the firing of cannons, lack skills required for effective defence in melee. However, the power and versatility of the unicorn guns on the battlefield more than make up for this weakness.\\n\\nThe first unicorn was cast by Andrey Chokhov, a Russian gun founder who began his career during the reign of Ivan the Terrible (1547-84). He supervised the creation of many of Russia’s most famous artillery pieces including the behemoth “Tsar Pushka”, or Tsar Cannon. This masterpiece was commissioned by Tsar Feodor and weighed a whopping 38 metric tons. It originally sat on a wooden carriage that was later destroyed during Napoleon’s attack on Moscow in 1812. It now sits in the Kremlin next to the “Tsar Bell”, the biggest bell ever made but never rung.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_3_Decker_British_2nd_Rate	\\n\\nThis three-deck warship is a modified “second rate” ship, and the addition of extra guns alters the balance of the vessel and consequently its handling. While a normal second rate is somewhat lumbering, this ship is even less handy and responsive to the helm. The benefits in terms of additional firepower do, however, handsomely compensate for a loss of manoeuvrability.\\n\\nHistorically, the 98-gun ship was created by simply adding extra guns to the quarterdeck and increasing the weight of some of the other cannon. However, few nations chose to commission original ships of this type, preferring to build normal “first rates” instead. Only the Royal Navy bothered, as it needed large ships to act as flagships on overseas postings. Nine 98-gun ships were ordered during the French Revolutionary Wars, including HMS Boyne and HMS Union, both ship names emphasising loyalty to the British Crown.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCulture3_grand_opera_house_european	\\n\\nThis impressive setting for musical performances allows the audience to delight in novel entertainments, and admire the good taste of the house’s patrons. Music is open to everyone and as a result the happiness of all classes is improved, although only the upper classes can afford the best seats and boxes. Little expense is spared on a grand opera house, particularly in the public areas visited by the important members of the audience. This prestigious building markedly improves the town wealth in its region.\\n\\nMany rulers in the 18th Century acted as a patron of the arts, and opera in particular. Apart from being fabulously and famously expensive (therefore demonstrating the patron’s wealth), the musical form was also growing in popularity and quality. Music advanced tremendously, with works from composers of genius such as Mozart, Handel and Scarlatti. Composers dedicated their works to great men, carried away by admiration or in the hope of patronage. The ideals of the French Revolution inspired Beethoven when he was writing his third symphony, the “Eroica”, but after Napoleon crowned himself Emperor, Beethoven furiously scratched out the dedication to him.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Guerrilla_Lanceros	\\n\\nThe sight and sound of thundering cavalry, lances thrust forward, is a fearsome thing to behold. Guerrilla Lanceros are supposed to use their horsemanship to punch a hole through enemy defences, causing casualties and possibly breaking the enemy in the process. After a charge, they should withdraw quickly and reform, as lances are too unwieldy to use in close combat. Staying for a prolonged fight might prove too dangerous for the lancers!\\n\\nNapoleon’s occupation of Spain and depredations by French soldiers outraged the Spanish, leading many of them to seek revenge. Julian Sanchez was an ex-soldier and farmer who raised a band of Guerrilla Lancers after the French brutalised his family. Sanchez grasped that light cavalrymen with an intimate knowledge of the country could carry out small, but damaging, attacks. His lancers would lay in wait for days and then ambush small convoys, gathering intelligence as they did so. In the process, French morale was damaged and the lives of the French were made as miserable and dangerous as possible. He quickly gained the attention of the Duke of Wellington as well as the Spanish people, who showed their respect by addressing him as “Don Julian”.	false

Work is no longer tied to the force of a convenient river, reliant on the wind or limited by a man’s muscles. Progress and industry, simply, are no longer subject to Nature’s whims! The steam engine unleashes power wherever it is needed, leading to an accelerated growth of industrial production.\\n\\nExperiments with steam power can be traced all the way through history, as far back as the ancient Greeks and the Aeolipile. However, it was the atmospheric beam engine of Thomas Newcomen (1664-1729) that first used steam effectively and signalled a new age of industry. His design was later improved by James Watt (1736-1819). The more fuel-efficient, and thus cheaper to run, Watt Steam Engine provided power to run factories, pump water, and eventually propel all manner of vehicles.	false

The Antiguo Alcázar or Old Castle dated back to the 16th Century, but this burned down on Christmas Eve, 1734.\\n\\nKing Philip V, the first of the Bourbon rulers of Spain, ordered a new palace to be constructed. Perhaps he had it in mind to create a rival to Versailles, the palace of his grandfather, Louis XIV of France. In the event, he died before the construction work was complete and never lived in the New Palace, as it was only in 1764 that Carlos III occupied the building. As a setting for a monarchy, however, the palace had been well worth waiting for! It is vast: with 2800 rooms it is far bigger than any other European palace. \\n\\nIt is still the official residence of the Spanish monarchy, although it is only used for state occasions.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_star_fort_earthworks_indian	\\n\\nBy European standards, this fortress looks like something of a relic from an earlier age, but to underestimate the defences would be very foolish. Packed earth ramparts behind the thick, high walls not only give extra fighting space to the defenders, but also deaden enemy cannon fire, absorbing the impact of shot and shell. Any attacker attempting to breach the defences must be prepared for a long siege, followed by a bloody and dangerous assault.\\n\\nHistorically, some of the most impressive fortifications ever constructed were the product of the Ottoman and Mughal empires. The quality of workmanship demanded was extremely high, even palatial in its luxurious attention to detail. The Red Fort at Agra remains an outstanding example of Mughal architecture, a fusion of native Indian, Persian and Islamic styles that remains impressive even today. Over 3000 people lived within its walls at one point, and the defences were certainly capable of protecting many more.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Elite_Republican_Guards	\\n\\nThe guard are trained to fight in the same fashion as line infantry, delivering volley fire from their smoothbore muskets. They are considered to be elite as they are chosen for their devotion to the national cause and for their personal courage. This devotion to freedom inspires other nearby troops to fight for their liberty and guards’ morale is almost boundless.\\n\\nHistorically, this unit had a ceremonial role, in much the same way as a royal or household guard would have in a monarchy, giving protection to the head of state. Their presence at formal occasions added legitimacy to the business of a republic. A republican guard was different from a royal guard in one other respect: it might include political officers, who watched for signs of disloyalty. The “palace guard” sometimes became the only unit a leader could trust when politics got out of hand. It was not unknown for the guard to take the role of “kingmakers”, even in a republic and give their protection to a presidential candidate they liked.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Small_Galley	\\n\\nIt is also heavily-armed, with 42-pounder cannons giving it a formidable weight of shot for each volley. It can also move directly into the wind, and even turn on the spot if the rowers on one side of the ship back water while their companions continue to row normally. These handy sailing qualities come at a price, though:  the large crew of rowers are vulnerable to grapeshot; the hull and oars are weak compared to a ship of the line.\\n\\nGalleys tended to be employed in relatively sheltered waters, and close to a friendly port, the second due to the large crew of rowers. The life of a rower can be brutal and short. Some countries use criminals at the oars, and these men are chained to the ship to prevent escape. If the ship goes down, however, the rowers perish with it. They are always confined below the fighting platform of the ship, and are in danger from grapeshot and broken oars. Indeed, a good raking with grapeshot will cripple a galley as surely as firing chainshot into the masts of a sailing vessel.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Inf_Gren_Ottoman_Beylik_Janissary_Grenadiers	\\n\\nThese grenadiers are the cream of the Ottoman army, but in comparison to other nations they fight in an old-fashioned way. The Beylik Janissary are unusual because they are grenadiers that still carry grenades. Their relatively small numbers in a unit puts them at a disadvantage against more modern style soldiers, but what they compensate for this lack of numbers by their ferocity. The janissaries are personally brave to the point of foolhardiness; they are given to festooning themselves with weapons and think nothing of hurling themselves into any fight!\\n\\nHistorically, the corps of janissaries dates back to the 14th Century. They were intended to be a force that was to be completely loyal to the sultan. Boys as young as five were trained and, if necessary, converted to Islam. Janissaries were paid even when not at war, something unheard of in the medieval world! Over time, however, they became bureaucrats and administrators, and this gave them too much power within the Ottoman Empire. Eventually, the janissaries’ entrenched position in government and conservative outlook corrupted them. They became a force against any and all change, contributing to the Ottomans’ decline.	false

As a result, if they do find themselves on a battlefield, they should be expected to run away, and not handle their weaponry with any great proficiency. Militia may appear useless, then, but they are cheap to maintain and as plentiful as any bureaucrat could want.\\n\\nIn 1806, despite previous unfortunate experiences with disgruntled peasants, the Russian state recruited 600,000 serfs into the “opelchenie”, a militia. Training was basic, and weaponry similarly simple: the opelchenie were given pikes. After the French invasion of 1812 the opelchenie was no longer limited to serfs, and another 200,000 recruits joined in a national wave of patriotism. Some of this new cohort of serfs brought their own pitchforks and shovels as weapons. 	false

technologies_long_description_admin4_national_fervour	\\n\\nA country is not land. It is the people. A love of country can inspire great acts of heroism in individuals, and fierce defiance in everyone. It can make people fight against overwhelming odds and it can topple even the greatest enemy. The more a man believes in his cause, the better he will make war to protect his home and family. Reminders of a country’s traditions, heritage and glorious achievements will all increase patriotic fervour when the people need it most.\\n\\nSpanish popular pride was a huge factor in Napoleon’s defeat in the Peninsular War. When his armies occupied Spain in 1808, the French underestimated how fiercely the Spaniards would fight to regain their country. They also completely misunderstood the means that would be used: brigandage would become a tool of national liberation, not simple robbery. The central Spanish government collapsed, but in its place juntas and cortes appeared to rally the people and raise bands of guerrillas. Despite being as savage and brutal as the French occupiers, the guerrillas were regarded as folk heroes by the Spanish people.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Mounted_Inf_Swedish_Mounted_Jager	\\n\\nAlong with their horses, initiative, aggression and pace mark these men out from other infantry. Mounted Jägers carry standard smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets, but they do not rely on massed volley fire: they deliberately aim at individuals within the enemy ranks. This unsporting and selective fire can be delivered on foot or from horseback. It can disrupt enemy formations or drive off enemy skirmishers. These men are trained to shoot, not fight in hand-to-hand battles, and will be worsted in a melee.\\n\\nHessian mercenary Captain Johann Ewald was a field commander of the Jäger corps and a prolific writer. He documented his life as a soldier during the American Revolution and created maps of the areas he spent time in, with detailed information about the placement of troops and fortifications. Ewald was the son of a bookseller and began his military career at the age of sixteen, quickly attaining the rank of captain and given command of a group of Jägers. After taking part in several key battles during the American Revolution, it became apparent that Ewald had progressed as far as his social class would allow and he decided to join the Danish army, where he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Gen_Tsar_Alexander	\\n\\nThis man’s presence alone is enough to inspire the battle-weary rank and file great efforts, even in their bleakest moments. A general who carries the respect of his troops is a valuable asset and should be protected in battle. Apart from anything else, it is not wise to expose the Tsar to the cut and thrust of battle. He should have his mind on command, not dodging bullets.\\n\\nThe circumstances that surrounded Alexander I’s death were intriguing, even in comparison to his interesting life. In 1825, his wife’s doctors recommended a trip to the Russian southern city of Taganrog, as the Tsarina had been sick for some time. During their stay, Alexander developed typhus and died. The sudden and unexpected nature of his death led many to speculate that he had faked his own death and left the country to begin a new life in peace and solitude. Some even believed that he took the name Feodor Kozmich and became a hermit, although this was never proven. Regardless of rumour or truth, when Tsar Alexander’s tomb was opened by the later Soviet government it was found to be completely empty.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Steam_Ship_Frigate	\\n\\nCarrying powerful 32-pounder cannon, this frigate is a valuable asset to any admiral. At close range, her guns fire a powerful broadside, but this does not make her invulnerable. No frigate has a hull that can withstand a broadside from a ship-of-the-line, and in this case the paddle wheels are vulnerable too. While a paddle-wheel powered frigate is not entirely at the mercy of the wind, it is not possible to carry enough fuel to cruise over long distances; steam is a tactical advantage, not a strategic one.\\n\\nPaddle wheels were a logical reversal of the idea of a waterwheel, simply reversing the idea of the water flowing past the wheel and providing energy. They were originally used in river-going craft, and it was not until 1819 that the first seafaring paddle-wheel ship, SS Savannah, made the first steam-powered crossing of the Atlantic, from Savannah, Georgia, to Liverpool in England. Savannah did run out of fuel off Ireland, but eventually made landfall and then, after refitting, pressed on to St. Petersburg in Russia, where the Tsar's government was so impressed that it made a cash offer for the ship. The valuation wasn’t good enough.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sPrest_Prussian_Siegessäule	\\n\\nPride in one’s nation is a powerful thing, and what better way to instil national pride than to build a structure that celebrates the great achievements of the country? Be it past victories, advances in education and technology, or a collection of treasures, such structures provide a stage to display achievements to the world. National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\\n\\nThe Siegessäule, or Victory Column, was built to commemorate Prussia’s victory in the Danish-Prussian War of 1864. However, it took so long to build that when it was eventually finished in 1873 Prussia had succeeded in winning two more wars! These later victories, against France and Austria, were the reason why a statue of the goddess Victoria was added to the top of the sandstone pillar. The base of the pillar was decorated with four bronze reliefs that depict the three victories and the glorious return of Prussian troops to Berlin.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_opera_house_european	\\n\\nNo expense is spared on making an opera house a grand venue. An opera house rivals many great palaces with the luxury of its fixtures and fittings, as these public areas for the audience are more important than the entertainment. Theatrical contrivances and mechanical tricks may make the staging as grand as the music, but for the elite it is the gossip, plotting and backbiting that is the real pleasure of a night at the opera.\\n\\nIn the 18th Century opera was done in the Italian “serious” style, a musical form that influenced many non-Italian composers including Mozart. The plots were intentionally simple, based on Classical themes, usually tragic and often had a highly conservative bent – as befitted the tastes of the patrons paying for the music. Many are still performed today. One fashion that has (mercifully) ended is the use of castrati singers: young men gelded so that their voices did not break and remained in the soprano range.	false

unit_description_texts_long_description_text_Cav_Heavy_Russian_Chevalier_Garde	\\n\\nThe Chevaliers Gardé is the senior unit of the Russian Imperial Guard cavalry, charged with the personal protection of the Tsar. Only the most experienced troops gain entry into this esteemed unit, and they are as expert in close combat and horsemanship. Armed with straight, heavy cavalry swords and protected by cuirasses, they are a force to be respected. As heavy cavalry, however, they can rarely keep pace with the light cavalry.\\n\\nIn 1800, the Russian Chevaliers Gardé regiment was formed by Tsar Paul, a reorganisation of the existing Chevalier Guard corps. It had been a ceremonial regiment, but after 1800 the Gardé were an active field force as well. This apparently egalitarian fairness in expecting his bodyguards to actually do some fighting was about as far as Paul’s levelling instinct went. Other reforms he carried out included shutting down all private printing presses in Russia and the banning of the words “society”, “revolution” and “citizen”.

technologies_long_description_military5_rifled_cannons	\\n\\nOrdinary naval cannons are smoothbore weapons, meaning that the barrel is a simple tube to contain the explosion. The limitations of casting mean that cannons are quite crude and windage, the gap between barrel and shot, is always a problem. A shot often “rattles” down the barrel when fired, making it inherently inaccurate. The loss of accuracy with a smoothbore makes its maximum range of academic interest only, simply because it becomes a matter of luck rather than judgement to hit anything far away!\\n\\nA rifled cannon solves these problems. By using machines to bore out the barrel from a blank casting, one inaccuracy is removed. Another machine cuts a helical pattern of grooves into the barrel wall. This imparts a spin to any shot as it travels down the barrel, and a spinning projectile flies true. This makes the effective range of a rifled cannon shot much greater than one from a smoothbore, although the maximum range for both is similar.\\n\\nHistorically, rifled cannons used manufacturing techniques developed for making accurate steam pistons and cylinders.	false

building_description_texts_long_description_sCulture5_Prussian_Universität	\\n\\nPride in one’s nation is a powerful thing, and what better way to instil national pride than to build a structure that celebrates the great achievements of the country? Be it past victories, advances in education and technology, or a collection of treasures, such structures provide a stage to display achievements to the world. National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\\n\\nWilhelm von Humboldt, the Prussian minister for education, founded Germany’s oldest university, the Universität zu Berlin, in 1810. Originally named for Frederick William III, the university quickly became Germany’s biggest education facility. It was so successful that it became the model for several other European universities, thanks to its modern curriculum and specialist scientific research institutes, the like of which the world had never seen. The university went on to nurture some of the greatest minds of the last two centuries, and can boast an amazing 29 Nobel Prize winners amongst its alumni.	false
