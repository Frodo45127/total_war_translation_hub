building_description_texts_long_description_vik_scribes_long	Before the development of early printing presses in the late medieval period, one of a monk's duties was transcribing and archiving, a physical labour that was part of his daily regime. Those chosen to be scribes were handed an unenviable task – the process of transcribing was back-bending, eye-straining work, with extended periods spent in badly lit, claustrophobic environments. Some monasteries had dedicated writing rooms attached to libraries, known as 'scriptoriums', but not all had such specialised areas. In fact, monks frequently had to find secluded spaces to do their writing wherever they could, such as their own rooms or small areas around the monastery cloister. Much of the scribe's work was religious, writing down passages from the Bible or the Psalms, which would then be recited often as part of daily life, giving the monks a closer understanding of both the text and the tenets of their religion as they worked.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_bullaun_long	A curious feature of monastic sites from Ireland’s era of Christianisation are ‘bowl’ or ‘bullaun’ stones. These artificially hollowed-out basins in rocks, boulders and slabs were used as far back as Neolithic times, but their importance to pre-Christian Irish peoples was sufficient for the early Celtic Church to want to assimilate them. These man-made fossils likely had practical uses for ancient peoples, with archaeological excavations at one site in southeastern Ireland revealing that there may have been an ironworking industry there. The bringing of bowl stones to early Celtic Christian sites strongly implies they also had spiritual or devotional functions pre-Christianity, with records located at pilgrimage sites indicating they were used in rituals. Additionally, Celtic Christian tradition records that those who drank from the stones were healed.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_craft_merchant_long	As their society developed in step with sustained periods of relative peace, the Britons, Saxons and Vikings living in the British Isles gradually moved away from basic subsistence bartering to a much more sophisticated trade model. Regular markets, permanently based around local fortresses close to rivers for ease of transport, sprung up all across the country, enabled producers to trade their surplus supplies for things they were unable to produce themselves. This gradually gave rise to a burgeoning class of merchants. Without a reliable, consistently-maintained road system, the riverways were the natural way to transport their goods, as they removed the need for trains of pack-horses and made attacks by brigands far less likely.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_orchard_long	The historian Tacitus recalled that grape growing was present in Britain as far north as the Midlands prior to the Saxon arrival, despite the overly-moist soil and atmosphere in most parts of the Isles. In fact, many indigenously-grown fruits have ever been consumed all over Britain, with excavations dating back to the early Middle Ages pointing to the consumption of apples, plums, cherries, and sloes in abundance. Vineyards were recorded in the manuscript records of the Domesday book, with various royal estates in present-day Wiltshire, Worcestershire, Hampshire, and Somerset known to have been deliberately built upon orchards to take advantage of the literal fruits of the land. Various fruit-based wines were also being concocted, with evidence in Gloucester dating back to the period pointing to the presence of a large deposit of apple pips, likely to have been the result of large-scale cider production.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_alehouse_long	Thanks to the Romans, the great British pub actually started out two thousand years ago as a great Italian wine bar! Roman taverns, or ‘tabernae’, were originally set up as shops that sold wine, with a deliberate proximity to Roman roads so that many a legionary could be provided with a place to sit and quench his thirst. With ale being Britain’s native brew at the time, taverns quickly adapted to provide locals with whichever tipple they wanted, assuming it was available and the price could be paid. Through times of invasion from Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and others, alehouses and taverns thrived in Britain, eventually evolving into places that also provided food and accommodation for weary travellers such as merchants, court officials, or pilgrims. Being places of congregation in a non-religious sense, taverns also served military purposes, acting as recruitment centres for royal armies, and even for less savoury groups such as mercenaries or bandits.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_hunting_long	The concept of "The Hunt" predates recorded history; earlier human ancestors relied on hunting to survive, making it a cornerstone of the species. Despite the advent of agriculture, hunting remained important as a source of sustenance, recreation, and industry, with hides fetching as high a price as animal meat did. Hunting was carried out all across society in the early medieval British Isles, but for the elite in particular, it was an important physical pursuit. Stag-hunting, fox-hunting, and hawking were favourite pastimes of kings and nobles, and the Vikings settlers would have had a similar propensity for such outdoor activities. Excavations of sites dating back to the Dark Ages reveal sizeable amounts of antler bones, and aside from deer, hunters would have also killed hare and wild boar. Wild birds, including swans, mallards, geese, and pigeons, also provided sources of meat, with large bone deposits suggesting that birds were a significant food source for many.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_pottery_long	Clay has always been abundant in the British Isles, and before the traditional wheel-throwing techniques of pottery shaping were introduced at the end of the Iron Age, they were painstakingly shaped by hand. From the 8th century, however, pottery in Britain began to be mass-produced at industrial centres using better techniques and large purpose-built kilns. The most important centre of pottery manufacture in the era was Ipswich, which at the time transported such products to all corners of Britain. East Anglian pottery finds were commonly associated with high-status sites, indicating how highly they were valued. The presence of the Vikings, especially in urban centres like York, also appears to have affected the quality and quantity of pottery items in some places where more standardised, wheel-thrown and kiln-fired pottery was seen, mass-produced for trade using influences brought in from continental Europe.	true

building_description_texts_long_description_vik_fishing_long	Living in a land of long coastlines and winding rivers, the communities of the British Isles always had fish as a staple food resource. Evidence for the industrial-scale exploitation of fish dates back to the sixth century, but history tells us that some groups were still lagging behind until sometime after that. This was the case for the South Saxons of Sussex, who the historian Bede mentions were on the brink of famine in the seventh century until Bishop Wilfred taught them how to fish while on his conversion mission. Fishing methods changed relatively little throughout the Dark Ages, but were impacted by techniques brought to the Isles by outside settlers such as the Vikings. For example, the large volumes of sea fish being caught by the end of the Anglo-Saxon period were a direct result of the drift net – an imported Viking method which enabled a much greater catch out at sea.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_mountain_hall_long	Din Eidyn, the early medieval name for modern-day Edinburgh, had long been a location of significance to the numerous groups vying for power in the lands of the southern Scottish Lowlands known as the Old North. It was an area mostly inhabited by people of Celtic descent, remaining culturally and linguistically British even after the arrival of foreign groups. One of the rulers whose seat of power was located in Eidyn was Mynyddog Mwynfawr, king of the people who inhabited the Old North during the latter part of the 6th century. His name roughly translates to ‘Wealthy Mountain’, and he was alluded to as a great king who oversaw the resistance struggles of his people against the hostile expansionist kingdoms to the south. According to ancient Brythonic poetry, it was from his halls of power based in Eidyn that he sent a hand-picked elite retinue of three hundred mounted warriors on an ill-fated expedition southward against an Angle-controlled fort in Yorkshire. Although their excursion ended with their defeat and demise, the warriors and their king ‘of the mountain’ were immortalised in prose for their efforts, living on in memory through the eulogies of legendary poets.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_pasture_long	People living on the British Isles during the Anglo-Saxon period relied heavily on cattle, sheep, and pigs to provide the protein that their diets required, with bone evidence showing that pasture farming was widely practiced alongside agriculture and woodland management. Cattle offered a form of mobile wealth, especially in royal circles, as corroborated by the large number of cattle skulls dating back to the 7th century found in the palace enclosure at the historical site of Yeavering. In larger, more urban surroundings of the day such as Viking-occupied York, smaller livestock like pigs and goats were reared within tenement yards, while cattle and sheep were reared in the surrounding countryside and brought on the hoof to market. The meat of the animals wasn’t the only valuable commodity, but also the animal by-products such as wool, skins, leather, and bones for tools. Cattle dung was also highly useful, providing manure to aid agriculture in less fertile soils.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_celi_de_abbey_long	Long before the total conversion of the pagan Saxons, southern Britannia had seen the gradual spread of Christianity from the pockets of followers left by the Romans, accelerated in later centuries with Augustine’s Gregorian mission. In Ireland and parts of the north, however, a very different picture was emerging in the form of Celtic Christianity. In the two hundred years after the Romans had departed, a significant gulf had formed between the Celtic and Roman missions, which saw Celtic monotheistic spirituality develop freely in isolation from Rome’s dominion. By the end of the sixth century, Celtic Christianity was wholly monastic in its structure, spearheaded by ascetic communities in Ireland whose efforts saw the large-scale conversion away from paganism on the island. Several aspects of the Celts’ tribal outlook were reflected in their newly-emerging religious practices, with an understanding of faith that celebrated grace and nature as gifts from God, with strong traditions of poetry, mysticism, and inclusion of women in its leadership.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_granary_long	Archaeological evidence indicates that the main catalyst for the human transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer was the cultivation of wheat and grain. A useful food source both directly and as an animal feed, grain was highly important to sedentary societies for thousands of years, dating back to Neolithic times. Its obvious advantage was the ability to harvest a surplus, which gave rise to the need for granaries. In Britain, the Roman villa system meant that a vast amount of farming was taking place before the era of Saxon dominance, and subsequent settlers on the Isles continued using the old Roman techniques of grain storage. Granaries had raised floors to allow air to circulate, keeping the yield dry and mould-free, as well as protecting it against ground-based pests. The bulkiness of surpluses also meant that granary walls had to be thick enough to resist great weight, while extra-wide eaves ensured that walls also stayed absolutely dry.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_garrison_long	Not all warriors fight on the front line, at the literal bleeding edge of war. In a world before professional, large-scale armies, garrisons were used as a method of cultural conversion, and then as a defensive redoubt. The Romans called their process of garrisoning 'colonia', which involved settling citizens in conquered towns to Romanise the population. This occurred in Britain before the dominance of the Saxons, who later used a ‘fyrd’ system of mobilised armies made up of self-equipped freemen. For many groups of that era, in the most desperate times of war every able-bodied man would have been encouraged to fight, but where men could be spared a garrison would have been left behind to help protect the populace and their commodities. In the worst of times, however, when kingdoms suffered significant losses, garrisons were reserved for the most valuable of settlements. After all, kingdoms could be rebuilt, but a warrior could only die once.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_assembly_long	In the early medieval world, the governance of the populace was aided by areas where large congregations of people could be addressed directly by their leaders. As the kings of post-Roman Britain saw the number of people under their rule increase, they needed more effective ways to consolidate their power over them. Appearing before their subjects in person and speaking to them face-to-face was one such method, and the use of outdoor assembly areas made it possible in practice. The king still had to get to such places, however, travelling with his retinue to settlements with such facilities, where his subjects in the area would congregate before him. Archaeological evidence in Northumbria indicates that outdoor assemblies and grandstands were, in effect, like the parliament buildings of the early Middle Ages, where it was likely some back-and-forth would have occurred between the king and his subjects. They were probably cuneiform in shape, triangular buildings with sitting-steps focused on an area bordered by a screen at the back and sides to aid voice amplification. Since they were places of royal use, they were contained within protected hill-forts or fortified parts of settlements.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_library_long	Even prior to King Alfred’s education reforms that he was so well-known for, historical records point to an earlier era of scholarship in England and Ireland coinciding with the region’s conversion to Christianity. In the time of Bede, the ‘Father of English History’, the libraries of the Dark Ages were exclusively places of ecclesiastical learning, used and run by monks in monasteries. Bede himself was an author, scholar, and priest, whose works imply that he had access to a great many books of contemporary and classical authors of his day. Indeed, it is known that Bede’s very own monastery had an impressive library of imported works. Most of the books found there would have been written in Latin, and his work alludes to a familiarity with Christian poets, classical historians and authors, Latin grammarians, and even some works in Greek, probably of theological origin.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_workshop_long	As Britannia settled into a period of uneasy peace following the Vikings’ settlement of the Danelaw during the 9th century, the work of British craftsmen began to gain popularity both abroad and at home. As a result of increases in demand, particularly from Church building projects which required highly-skilled, ornate workmanship delivered to tight deadlines, small ‘cottage’ industries gave way to workshops where production could be better organised to meet the cost and time constraints of the project in hand.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_artisans_long	Jewellery was always very important to the Anglo-Saxons, with fine objects being crafted from precious metals such as gold, amethyst and even amber depending on the social status of the wearer. Due to the diverse nature of Isles’ population, it’s unsurprising that much of the jewellery produced around the time of the 7th and 8th centuries, particularly in Saxon and Viking England, had central and northern European influences at first. Over time, however, a unique, insular style developed here which fed back into central and southern Europe, with the work of Saxon jewellers adorning churches as far south as Rome itself. As a result of this demand, goldsmiths in particular were allowed to move freely wherever their work took them.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_copper_long	Copper is the oldest known metal in the world, the use of which dates back many centuries BC. It was known to the Greeks and Romans as 'cuprum' or 'cyprium', a reference to Cyprus, one of the largest copper mines in the ancient world. It is the primary ingredient of bronze, and although the bronze age ended in roughly 1200 BC to give way to the widespread use of iron, the good rust resistance of copper alloys guaranteed the continued use of bronze in a variety of outdoor applications. It was used for things like door components, fountains, statues, horse-related apparatus, buckles, and anything else that might be exposed to moisture. Copper was also collected, traded, and used by the Vikings, especially for jewellery, with places like 9th century Viking-occupied York known to have been a location of the manufacture of many such trinkets for trade purposes.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_silver_long	By the end of the 8th century, most silver used to mint coins on the British Isles was thought to have originated overseas. Local veins had been worked out from Roman times, and mining technology was beyond the experience and investment potential of the time. Eventually, however, Britain and Ireland’s small-scale silver mining industries grew to cater for the increased use of coin in commercial transactions. Shallow enriched ore deposits in Carboniferous Limestone areas were put into use, although deeper-seated deposits of higher yields would not be exploited until several centuries later. In the invading Vikings’ hands, silver was donned in various forms as high-status dress items or broken up as a form of hack-silver currency. Hoard findings dating back to the ninth century also indicate that most plundered Viking silver was likely kept until eventually melted down into more acceptable forms more useful to their bullion economy, such as ingots and rings.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_estate_long	With the collapse the Roman Empire, Europe of the Middle Ages evolved the Roman villa system into three elements; the feudal system, manorialism and serfdom. In Britain, many kings of the land used a system in which they would garner favour from their nobles and their retinues by bequeathing their estates scattered throughout their realm. Estates were highly profitable for a noble or ealdorman, largely used to provide coin for things like payments to armies, or the hiring of labour to build fortifications and bridges in the surrounding area. Estate manors were also used as royal accommodation, as kings commonly moved from one estate to another when travelling and conducting royal business. It was no small matter to offer hospitality to royal company, and it was not uncommon for purveyors to inspect a royal estate for its provisions and amenities the day before a royal visit, if not only to ensure an adequate supply of mead!	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_market_long	By the time of Viking settlement on the British Isles, the locals were already trading in at least two important commodities on a large scale – salt and metals. The former was crucial for meat and fish preservation, while the latter was needed to make the tools and weapons with which livelihoods were made and protected respectively. In agricultural trade, most large-scale farmers produced yields of crops to fulfil an obligation to a lord or king on top of their own subsistence, but any surplus would then be sold at a grain exchange or fair. The Viking threat to the Isles also provided a motor for trade there, with centres of commerce blossoming where people had gathered to live more safely in greater numbers. In fact, several 9th century market towns prospered due to their proximity with King Alfred the Great’s 'burhs', a system of forts originally established as a network of Saxon strongholds to defend against invasion.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_court_long	Although Welsh law became increasingly superseded by English law in the 13th century, Wales had a rich legal tradition dating back to a few hundred years before that. The 10th century Welsh monarch Howel Dda, also known as 'Howel the Good', was chiefly remembered for consolidating all the laws used to govern Welsh lands, which gradually fell into his dominion through his marital ties and deaths in his ruling family. He did not create the laws as such – many actually predated his lifetime – but he was believed to have adapted existing law traditions to codify into his own legal tenets, which came to be known as the 'Law of Howel'. It is thought that his epithet 'the Good' was due to the fact that his laws did not overly stress his royal power, but instead were aimed at protecting the people of Wales. Living under Howel’s laws became one of the definitions of Welsh people in the centuries to come, with the Welsh lawbooks and legal manuscripts of the era giving a fascinating insight into life in early medieval Wales.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_tanner_long	People have used hides to protect and clothe themselves ever since they began to trap and kill animals. As animal husbandry developed and the availability of hides increased, tanning processes were introduced to make leathers more durable. By the Middle Ages, tanning was becoming an important trade, with archaeological evidence of Saxon-era tanneries seen in places like Winchester, where two rectangular pits were found at Lower Brook Street. The pits were lined with clay and wood, with a water channel running through the room which was wide enough to wash hides, and traces of animal hairs found around the pits assumed to be sweepings from the surrounding area. Most tellingly, these elements were all located in a house which fronted onto a road known as Tannerestret, the 'Street of the Tanners’, a name dating from the late 10th century. Today, there is a Tanner Street in many English towns and cities.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_konungsgurtha_long	Following the Vikings’ prolonged campaigns against the Saxons, part of the invading Great Army returned to Northumbria in AD 876 and the newly-conquered lands were shared out amongst them. York had already seen several battles and sieges by that time, with many parts of the city damaged from the struggles. Buildings such as the old Roman defences and towers had deteriorated into a poor condition, and those which were damaged but hadn't yet fallen were demolished by the new settlers. In addition to cultivating the surrounding land with the intention to stay permanently, history also relates how the Vikings rebuilt parts of the city. The southwest gate of the original fortress had survived, so was used to form part of a new royal palace of the Viking kings, a building that became known as the ‘Konungsgurtha’, or the ‘King’s Court’ in Old Norse. It acted as the seat of the subsequent Viking rulers of Northumbria in the following years and nucleated the city, with new streets and timber houses added to the surrounding area over time.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_grianan_ailech_long	One of the most magnificent remnants of the Irish-Gaelic kingdoms of old is the 1500 year-old circular hillfort known as Grianan of Aileach. Still standing on Greenan Mountain today, the monument was once a bastion of the Kingdom of Aileach, which flourished between the 5th and 12th centuries. However, the location’s importance stretches back several thousands of years before that. A prehistoric burial mound is evidence of human activity as far back as Neolithic times. The great stone ringfort there today has been restored from the one built by the ruling Ui Neill dynasty in the 6th century, but an older hillfort was one of just five Irish sites on Ptolemy of Alexandria’s 2nd century map of the world, indicating that the site was in similar use far earlier.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_thing_long	Wherever the Vikings arrived to settle, they brought their customs and legal systems with them, as it was during their settlement in Britain. In the latter part of the 9th century, the area in which the laws of the recently settled Danes held sway was known as the Danelaw – a geographical demarcation created after King Alfred of the West Saxons inflicted defeat upon them in AD 878, resulting in a treaty that granted them the lands of the ‘Five Boroughs’ in which to expound their own laws. It was in these regions that the freemen of Viking society would gather into ‘Things’ to settle their disputes out in the open. Things were groups of individuals assembled to make collective decisions, a practice considered to be the cradle of Scandinavian democracy. They would make important political decisions, while overseeing that laws were being upheld, and the ‘Thingsteads’ where they would gather were often the focal points for trade and religious activity. In Viking-age Britain, the use of Things was not confined to the Danelaw, but everywhere the Vikings settled, including Shetland, Orkney, the highlands of Scotland, and Man.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_fogou_long	Some of the oldest and most interesting examples of human habitation in ancient Cornwall are several ancient, man-made caves and passageways known as ‘fogous’, named for the Cornish word ‘fogo’, meaning ‘cave’. Although similar to souterrains and earth-houses found in Scotland and Ireland, the Cornish examples differ in that they were often found in more settled areas protected by earthwork defences and inhabited by several families. Fogous continued to be important into the Viking era and their proximity to settlements indicates they were probably places of refuge and storage, with constricting ‘creep’ entrances providing some level of hindrance to attackers. Another curious feature hints at ritualistic use, as their passageways were almost always orientated towards the rising and setting midsummer sun.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_dewi_long	Sometime in the early 6th century, as a wild thunderstorm battered the cliffs of modern-day Pembrokeshire in southwest Wales, Saint David was born. A man of considerable importance to the Celtic Church in his later life, he was originally named ‘Dewidd’, locally pronounced as ‘Dewi’. Accounts compiled many centuries after his lifetime allude to him being the son of a Welsh prince, with some legends claiming that his birth was foretold to Saint Patrick by an angel thirty years before it occurred. David was a puritan who practiced strict self-imposed penance, only consuming bread, vegetables, and water, and his most well-known miracle was the conjuring up of a hill beneath his own feet as he delivered a sermon to a large crowd, elevating himself so he could be seen and heard by all. David’s assignation as the patron saint of Wales is certainly attributed to many such legends and miracles, as well as tangible facts. Historically, he is thought to have founded many monasteries, including one in Menevia, near to his birthplace. The settlement which grew around it became known as ‘Tyddewi’, or ‘David’s House’, which later encompassed a site of great pilgrimage when it housed the great saint’s relics within the Cathedral of St David.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_cloth_long	Weaving is one of the oldest attested crafts in the world and, by antiquity, had permeated every level of society. In its most basic form, slaves and children manufactured cheap, functional cloth, but at the highest level it was practiced by noblewomen who produced rich tapestries and fabrics as a conspicuous display of wealth. In tenth-century Anglo-Saxon England, spinning, weaving, and sewing were almost exclusively female activities, attested to by the presence of a variety of cloth-making equipment in women’s graves dating back to the period. Textile production was always an important factor in most communities of the era, with plenty of evidence showing that Viking-age York was also producing large amounts of wool and flax textiles, although it is not clear whether surpluses were created for export. Findings of silk offcuts and headscarves, however, suggest that at least some textile workers were also handling exported material there.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_tools_long	Without the invention, innovation, and manufacture of tools, civilisation would not experience progress. Tools facilitate the necessities of survival, and where one tool is unsuitable, efforts are generally made to invent new ones. In many cases, such processes are organic and come about naturally by osmosis from other cultures. For example, there is no firm evidence for the use of an ox or horse-drawn plough by the Anglo-Saxons prior to the 10th century, but it is thought that before that time, land cultivation was carried out with the use of wooden harrows, such as the one depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry. Unsurprisingly, tool development has always been intrinsically linked to advancements in materials and metallurgy. With the Iron Age already well underway in Europe by the time the Romans withdrew from Britain, the use of iron tools was already fairly widespread by the time the Vikings arrived.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_thrall_long	The post-Roman era slave trade was reasonably active on the British Isles by the time of the Viking raids - a remnant of the socio-political systems left behind by the Romans themselves. Although the Romans never annexed Ireland specifically into their empire, they still had a commercial relationship with the island, creating a slave trade which even caused a depopulation there at the time. When the Viking kings settled, they brought with them their three-tiered stratification of society – noblemen, freemen, and thralls – which served to give the slave trade an even greater importance locally. Irish kings of the 10th century were also known to take swathes of slaves as booties of war, undoubtedly to profit from the burgeoning local slave markets of Ireland’s major ports at the time, which had been spearheaded by Viking settlement.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_arena_long	Fighting as entertainment has deep roots which stretch back to antiquity. Homer mentions boxing in his epic 'the Iliad' in the eighth century BC, and an early version of mixed martial arts combining fist-fighting and wrestling known as 'pankration' was a common sight at the early Olympic Games. More broadly, fist-fighting was a common way of settling disputes throughout history, especially in societies in which warfare was part of life such as Viking-era Britain. The works of the historian Bede mention wild, physical, and competitive games that were encouraged to develop the warrior elite of English society, and one might assume that one-on-one combat was amongst such activities. Although it may have ended in injury or death for one of the participants, fighting as a spectacle would have been considered much more valuable and honourable for the participant – and arguably more entertaining for the spectator – than other pastimes of the era such as bear-baiting and cock-fighting.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_church_crafts_long	Although a love of jewellery and crafts was already ingrained with British and Anglo-Saxon culture by the time of their conversion to Christianity, the Church nevertheless became a driving force for many of the crafts produced from that point onwards. Aside from metal and glass work, advanced textiles and tapestry-work became part of a signature style and votive pieces. In fact, on the continent ‘Opus Anglicanum’ (literally ‘English Work’) was considered to be among the finest of its kind produced at the time, and was used to decorate European churches from the 8th century until the Norman conquest of 1066.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_forge_long	The honest work of the blacksmith enabled land to be cultivated, ships to be built, stone to be quarried, and wars to be fought with more terrible savagery than ever before. During the Anglo-Saxon era, forges were commonly ephemeral in nature, often roofless to allow as much light in as possible to judge the state of work and surrounded by wattle wind-breaks rather than solid walls – nothing too costly to lose if loose sparks caused a fire. There was usually not much more than a hearth containing a heat source in addition to an anvil upon which the actual hammering took place, sometimes in the form of solid block of cast iron, especially in instances of large-scale production. Tongs, hammers, and bellows have also all been found in areas identified as forge sites of the early Middle Ages, all of which would have been absolutely essential to make a smithy’s painstaking job much easier.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_church_long	By the time the Vikings had settled down in Britain, Christianity had already gained a considerable foothold there. Having been brought to the Isles centuries earlier as one of many Roman cults, Christianity did not only outlive the Roman occupation, but survived in the face of the numerous forms of paganism brought by successive invaders such as the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and others. In the post-Roman period, the decaying stone remains left by the occupiers inspired settlers with superstitious awe, and provided Christian moralists with a fruitful theme to disseminate their beliefs amongst the population. Spurred on by the missions of Saint Augustine of Canterbury to convert the settled Germanic tribes, several churches were embedded within old Roman edifices throughout England, while in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, small monastic communities had already become the focal points of most villages. Such locations provided the nuclei for towns and cities which still exist to this day.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_port_trade_long	References to the first merchant ships in Britain date back to before the Viking invasions, with the occupying Romans of earlier centuries also being a large part of the maritime trade that was occurring in late antiquity. The works of the 5th century historian Orosius mention the Saxon word ‘ceapscip’, a direct translation of ‘trading ship’, the examples of which by that time had developed features that were distinctly non-military in function. For example, many had a broad high-sided hull to maximise cargo space, or a reliance on a sail as a primary means of propulsion, since sailing ships had less oarsmen aboard to facilitate more space for cargo. The Viking raids in Britain also resulted in several market ports prospering out of Alfred’s systematic 'burh' fortifications. Trading ports like Hastings and Southampton especially benefited, thriving from the presence of a local populace who sought the protection of the royally decreed forts in coastal areas.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_columbe_long	The cathedral which stands in Dunkeld, Scotland today is dedicated to Saint Columbe, one of the famed ‘Twelve Apostles of Ireland’ responsible for the spreading of early Christianity in the region. Its location has long been considered holy ground to Scottish Christianity, ever since Celtic missionaries built the first monastery there in the eighth century within the settlement previously known as ‘Dun Cailden’. It eventually became a major religious centre and place of pilgrimage, especially after Saint Columbe’s relics were moved there from the island of Iona in the face of increasing Viking raids in around AD 850. Columbe himself was, in fact, a descendant of Irish kings, but had become a luminary amongst the Scottish saints after his mission to convert the Gaels and Picts of Scotland in the 6th century. The monastery he set up in Iona became a place of great religious renown and spiritual authority, where several kings, both Gaelic and Viking, sought to be buried due to it being the resting place of Columbe himself, until his relics were moved to Dun Cailden in the 9th century.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_cuthbert_long	There are conflicting accounts about the early life of Saint Cuthbert, whose later gift for miraculous healing in an era of frequent sickness had earned him the label ‘Wonder-worker of England’. Flourishing during the 7th century, some historical sources claim he was the son of an Irish king, while others say he was born into poverty in Scotland and fought as young warrior in service to the Kingdom of Northumbria. In any case, Cuthbert became one of the most important figures of the Saxon church in his later life, taking up the priorship of Lindisfarne from AD 664 after Northumbria’s controversial decision to follow Rome’s Christianity in lieu of the already well-established Celtic tradition. Although renowned for being an outgoing, cheerful, and compassionate missionary, he spent his final years as a hermit, and by the time of his death had become so revered that his final resting place at Lindisfarne became a location of mass pilgrimage. Centuries later, the Viking invasions prompted the Lindisfarne monks to evacuate Saint Cuthbert’s remains from the island, and after seven years the relics eventually found their way to nearby Dunholm – modern-day Durham – where a church was built to house them, ironically benefacted by a converted Danish king.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_school_ros_long	In its beginnings as an early Christian settlement, the ancient Irish town of Rosscarbery in modern-day County Cork may have seemed comparatively unimportant, but it eventually became one of the most celebrated locations of religious learning in the Dark Ages. The Irish monk and eventual saint known as Fachtna came to the area towards the end of the 6th century and founded a monastery there, later the principal monastery in southwest Cork and the centre from which the Diocese of Ross developed. Most notably, Fachtna’s establishment came to include the famous scripture school known as the School of Ross, renowned at the time as one of the great seats of Christian education and sanctity. Such was the number of students and monks travelling to it from far and wide to study under the most eminent ecclesiastical professors, that the early form of the settlement’s name, ‘Ros’, meaning ‘wooded headland’ in Old Irish, became ‘Ros-Ailithir’, translating to ‘wooded headland of the pilgrims’. The settlement’s location on seaward slopes at the edge of sheltered cliffs was likely a deliberately defensible position, where the monks could watch for invaders, although the Vikings would not show up for at least another 150 years.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_high_cross_long	In the centuries following the missions of the monk Saint Fursey to convert the British Isles to Christianity, his homeland of Ireland saw the appearance of an art form considered to be their biggest contribution to western European art of the Middle Ages – the Celtic high cross. These free-standing structures mimicked the smaller crosses made out wood and metal common in the period with larger stone versions commonly placed in the grounds of monasteries and cemeteries, as well as sometimes being the focal point for town markets. They were generally used as meeting points for religious ceremonies, but were also placed at crossroads and used to mark out land boundaries. In Ireland, the earliest and most famous examples date back to the 8th or 9th century, and are situated within a few miles of each other in the southwest of the island. The Killamery High Cross located in County Kilkenny is one such example – not only because it is very richly sculptured in images and iconography which are decipherable even today – but also because it was built in a monastery established by a direct disciple of Saint Fursey himself, Saint Goban.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_warehouse_long	As Britannia’s late-Dark Ages arts and crafts culture advanced, systems of trade developed naturally in tandem with it. Merchants operated by purchasing more goods than they needed and then selling on the surplus for a profit, then – if they were shrewd – investing some of that profit back into their businesses. The nature of the free market means demand frequently outstrips supply and vice-versa. This means the serious merchant had to have somewhere to store goods safely, both from the elements and those who would take it from them – thus, warehouses as we know them were born. Generally, these storage spaces would be next the rivers or ports in order to transport the goods around inland or abroad as needed.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_embroiders_long	Spinning and weaving was a craft that earned Canterbury industrial prosperity at various points in its past, and history tells us that an older tradition of embroidery actually existed there as far back as the Dark Ages. A building that still stands in the city today known as ‘The Old Weavers’ House’ was where the Canterbury weavers of the sixteenth century gained their fame, but part of the structure is believed to date back to around the Anglo-Saxon era when the town was known as 'Cantwaraburg', and was a likely location for the production of Opus Anglicanum, or ‘English Work’. This medieval custom of decadent embroidery made use of gold thread, carried out by highly-skilled professionals who would take up to seven years to perfect their craft. The resulting work was unequalled in craftsmanship anywhere else in Europe at the time, resulting in much sought-after fabrics commonly donned as ceremonial clothing by royalty or the clergy, but also used for decorative purposes like the famous example of the Bayeux Embroidery. Another existing specimen is the gold and silk embroidery which drapes the reliquary coffin containing the relics of Saint Cuthbert in Durham Cathedral, identified as being West Saxon Opus Anglicanum work of the tenth century.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_ciaran_long	Saint Ciaran was one of the esteemed ‘Twelve Apostles of Ireland’, famously founding a great monastery at Cluain Mac Nois in County Offaly in the 6th century. It became the most influential religious facility of its time, notable for being where the 'Rule of St Ciaran' was developed, the set of ascetic tenets followed by most monastic institutions of the era. The monastery’s geographical location – right in the centre of Ireland positioned next to a river – was due to a premonition had by Ciaran and the famous monk Enda while he was studying under him on the island of Inishmore off the western coast of the mainland. Both men had the same vision of a fruit-laden tree growing on the banks of a stream in the middle of Ireland, with branches spreading out over the entirety of the land. They also saw birds carrying the tree’s fruits off to Britain and elsewhere, all of which Enda interpreted as his student's calling to travel to the centre of Ireland to found a church to spread their beliefs. This was how Ciaran came to establish his famous abbey at Cluain Mac Nois, which became a famous monastic town of the early Middle Ages.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_ringan_long	Known to the Northumbrians as ‘Trynnian’ or 'Ninian', Ringan of Whithorn was once considered one of the most important religious figures in Britain. Mentioned fleetingly by the great Northumbrian historian Bede, Saint Ringan was an important part of the Christianisation of the Picts during the 4th and 5th centuries. His greatest achievement, however, was the establishment of his monastery in Galloway. As Pictish Christian centres gradually came under Northumbrian Church control, Ringan’s monastery became a leading monastic centre for northern Anglo-Saxons. There are even several churches and chapels dedicated to him today, particularly in places of Pictish heritage or within old Northumbrian bounds.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_brigit_long	Saint Brigit of Nas is one of the best-known Irish saints after Patrick, and like him, much of what is known of her has been encapsulated in the folklore of the region. Her name is analogous with a Celtic goddess associated with many fables and myths of the era in which she lived, which added to her legend. After a childhood spent as a slave, she became known for unceasingly feeding and healing the poor and was famed for her extraordinary purity, piety, and generosity. Such was her reputation that in the late-5th century, the king of Leinster donated a plane of land to her in Nas, modern-day Kildare. On the site stood a large oak tree, under which Saint Brigit built her church known as the ‘Church of the Oak’, or ‘Cill Dara’ in Old Gaelic, after which county Kildare is named. It is widely considered to have been the first nunnery in Ireland, with many other communities of nuns founded by Brigit during her time. Many accounts describe her as a generous woman who performed miracles, and she is even sometimes considered to be a patron saint of beer, allegedly having the ability to turn dirty bathwater into the alcoholic beverage!	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_souterrain_long	The use of underground storage is something that the archaeological record shows was common in Ireland and northern Britain, with many examples of souterrains and ‘earth-houses’ distributed throughout Scotland dating back to Roman times. The meaning of souterrain is literally ‘underground’, and such places took the form of passageways, dwellings, and storage facilities hidden just beneath the surface. Their most likely function was food storage, as in Scotland they appear to have been a northern counterpart to the pits and silos of England used for grain surpluses in early medieval times. The evidence for this is a broad correlation between the locations of known souterrains from the period, and the areas known to have good quality arable land at the time. Such cool underground spaces would have also been suitable for milk or meat, while even livestock could have taken refuge in them, although this would have only happened in the largest facilities.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_swithun_long	Swithun was one of the most famous bishops of Winchester in the early medieval period, remembered for having great importance to his diocese during and after his 9th century lifetime. An immensely charitable soul who founded many churches, he was also an active counsellor to Saxon kings and even allegedly tutored the young Alfred the Great himself, helping to pave the future king’s way to his later accolades. Swithun had his holy reputation significantly boosted posthumously, after his remains were dug up from their original burial location outside Old Minster and placed within a splendid reliquary inside the building many years later, thus providing a new patron saint and focus of reverence for a newly-formed community of Benedictine monks. Saint Swithun's relics had been associated with several miraculous healing events by that time, but their exhumation and relocation went against his explicit wishes for his grave to be humbly placed outside where ‘the feet of ordinary men could pass over him’ and raindrops could fall upon it. In fact, legend has it that their removal from their original location was accompanied by forty days and forty nights of violent rain storms, a sign of the great saint’s displeasure at being displaced.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_sculptors_long	It has been suggested that Roman sculptured remains in the north of England may have formed the inspiration for a school of sculptors in the region, who produced works of outstanding merit during and after the Viking settlement of Britain. Rich evidence of historical sculpturing traditions exists in southern Scotland, Cumbria, and Yorkshire, with Glasgow in particular being home to the famous stones of one of its former burghs, Govan. Known as the ‘hogbacks’, they are an impressive collection of 10th century sandstone blocks unique to northern Britain, carved in elaborate symbols and decoration. They were imposing monuments distinctively Norse in style, thought to have been made to make the tombs of the dead look like mighty buildings. At the time of their creation, no other part of Europe was known to be producing sculpture of comparable quality. The Viking influence is indicative of their cultural influence in the region, and in fact, Govan’s rise to prominence as the centre of power for the local chieftains was a direct result of the Norse sacking of Dumbarton in AD 870. Above all, the Govan stones are indicative of the strong connection that kingdoms like Strathclyde and other northern lands had with the Scandinavian world.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_edmund_long	Edmund was king of East Anglia when the Danish army rampaged across it in AD 870, and eventually met his end at their hands. He was not the first or the last king to be killed by a Viking army, but it was a sensationalised version of his death that resulted in a cult forming around him which endured well into the medieval period. As the story goes, King Edmund was initially captured and offered the chance to surrender, but adamantly insisted that he would only do so on the condition that the Danish leader Ivar the Boneless be baptised. Other accounts say that he also refused to renounce his faith when challenged to do so, nor would he accept that his kingdom become a vassal to the Danish heathen overlords. In any case, the enraged Vikings tied him to a tree for his insolence, filled him with arrows, and beheaded him. Edmund’s martyrdom quickly made him a beacon of resistance for Christians under Danish heathen subjection, as shown by the coins etched with his image appearing within decades of his death. Interestingly, once the Danes converted and became widely settled in the region, they too venerated the shrine of Saint Edmund.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_apple_ash_long	Certain records of the early Middle Ages relate that in the lands of south Wales near to the mouth of the River Wye, there once stood a mysterious grove of curiously unique fruit-bearing trees. The early ninth-century Welsh antiquary known as Nennius referred to them in his works as ‘apple-bearing ash trees’, which would have had a miraculous existence to the people of the time, since ash trees do not typically bear apple-like fruits. Interestingly, Nennius referred to the grove as ‘Metambala’, a name also seen in Roman records thought to be a corruption of the ancient Greek name ‘Nemetabala’, meaning ‘Sacred Grove of Apple Trees’. In reality, these were likely to be references to a rare cluster of Sorbus Domestica, a tree of edible fruits known to have once grown in sparse locations in Britain, but no longer. For the people of the Dark Ages, however, no other trees had more associations of an ancient, mystical, or sacred nature than ash trees, particularly ones which bore fruit. In fact, dendrologists assert that the Sorbus Domestica had never been indigenous to Britain and were probably imported by the Romans, another reason that the people of the post-Roman era may have considered them so extraordinary.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_guildhall_long	Following the agrarian backwardness of the post-Roman era, the gradual growth of towns in Britain led to the formation of guilds. In modern terms, these groups could be considered the labour unions of the time, and were broadly split into two types – merchant guilds and craftsmen guilds. Before then, merchants had mostly existed as independent peddlers travelling from town to town, carrying out their own transactions at the mercy of local taxes. At the same time, the artisans of day often operated with unregulated prices, since they were craftsmen and not businessmen, causing them to come under scrutiny from customers. Guilds protected both workers and consumers – one merchant by himself would find it difficult to challenge unfairly high taxes, whereas the guilds had much more power in that respect. For consumers, guilds ensured standardisation of business and crafting practices, meaning they would not be getting unfair deals or sub-standard quality goods. Guild members would regularly gather in a guildhall to discuss matters of their trade, and to take payment from their members. In fact, the word ‘guild’ comes from the Saxon word ‘gilden’ meaning ‘to pay’, referring to the subscription payments made by its members.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_longphort_long	Entries in the Annals of Ulster for AD 842 speak of the Vikings’ first overwintering in Ireland as a highly remarkable event, which marked the beginning of their founding of several fortified naval bases known as ‘longphorts’. The initial Viking forays into Ireland and its surrounding isles in the previous century were typically rapidly executed raids to extract plunder followed by fast getaways by sea, but over time the duration of their stays were extended as they sought to take advantage of more raiding opportunities with each trip. Unlike on the British mainland where existing structures such as old Roman forts were often commandeered as base camps, in Ireland the Vikings built coastal earthwork defences from scratch, setting up camps in defensible positions such as shorelines cut off from inland areas by rivers or other geographical features. Many of these locations were the nuclei for a string of longphorts all along the Irish coastline in the modern-day locations of Waterford, Wexford, Limerick, and most importantly, Dublin, which became the Vikings’ principal base on the island in the era of Viking settlement.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_achadh_bo_long	The history of the Irish hamlet of Aghaboe is closely tied to Saint Canice, one of the famed ‘Twelve Apostles of Ireland’ who founded an abbey there in the 6th century. ‘Cainnech’ - as he was then known - was extremely well travelled and educated, which was reflected in Aghaboe’s prominence as a major centre for learning. Although a man of the cloth, he is said to have led a Christian force against the last archdruid at Kilkenny, symbolically ending paganism in Ireland. During Cainnech’s time, both Aghaboe and Kilkenny fell under Osraige’s (an early-medieval Irish kingdom) jurisdiction, with his abbey serving as its principal church and royal burial place, also having commercial and agricultural significance, as implied by the Gaelic name ‘Achadh Bó’, meaning ‘field of the cows’.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_runestone_long	Although laconic in nature, runestones provide an invaluable snapshot into the Viking Age. Several of these stone monuments inscribed with the Scandinavian alphabet are found in the Isle of Man, a place with little written historical record of Vikings, but much physical evidence of their past presence. Apart from numerous burial mounds there that have since been proven to be of Viking origin, many examples of runestones still survive, and appear to have served a similar purpose to Celtic high crosses – memorials to the dead. Little is known about the conversion of Norse settlers to Christianity, but at some point in the 9th or 10th centuries, the Norse settlers in Man started burying their deceased in existing Christian cemeteries. It is here that an apparent amalgamation of traditions took place, with many existing runestones taking the form of standing cross slabs carved with decoration on both sides. Additionally, the faces of these monuments were carved with images such as knot-work, interlacing patterns, or ring chains, sometimes accompanied by runic writing clearly indicating their Viking origin.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_martyrs_mint_long	At the beginning of the Viking Age, few Norse peoples would have had any knowledge of coinage, apart from some foreign coins that may have entered as a result of trade. Their bullion-based economy – that is, an economy based on the weight and purity of precious metals rather than their form or symbolism – meant that in many cases coins were melted down to make jewellery or ornamental weapons, the most common symbols of status for the Vikings. Their arrival in Britain brought them into contact with the monetary economy of the Isles, with each of the main Anglo-Saxon kingdoms having their own coinage systems. With Viking settlement came the creation of their own coins, serving as interesting evidence of the amalgamation of cultures that took place. Not only is there evidence on coins which depict both Christian and Viking-pagan symbolism, but also that the settled Vikings recognised martyrs such as Saint Edmund of East Anglia, who was purportedly killed by the Danes, then later venerated by them with their transition to the Christian faith.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_st_patraic_long	Political turmoil between the northern Irish kingdoms of the Dark Ages led to the early rise in importance of the hill fort which stood at Ard Macha in the 4th century. The town which grew there eventually became one of the ecclesiastical capitals of the medieval world, adopted as a metropolitan diocese by Saint Patrick and the location of his principal church built some time in the 5th century. The story of the legendary saint himself before that time is one embellished with so many legends and tales that it is difficult to separate some facts from fiction. Born to a family in Britain, Patrick's teenage years spent as a slave in Ireland saw him fervently turn to his faith before his escape. As with many sainthood stories, however, the central turning point of his life was a later vision that compelled him to return to Ireland where he travelled the length and breadth of the land to baptise, convert, and confirm with indefatigable zeal. It was this famous mission that turned the island to the Christian God and inspired the founding of countless churches there, like the one he established himself in Armagh, Northern Ireland, the modern-day location of the old hill fort at Ard Macha.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_wood_long	In the early medieval period, the landscapes of the British Isles were home to great stretches of continuous forest, far more extensive than their modern remnants. Agriculture was vitally important to those who lived off the land, but significant amounts of uncultivated woodlands were often kept as carefully managed resources, and for good reason. Timber has been essential for life and trade for as long as humans have cut down trees, with domestic, military, and naval applications, and forests were also important habitats for hunted animals. Woodworking was also an important industry in places like Viking-occupied York, where a myriad of different wooden items were manufactured and traded. In fact, the ancient street in York known as Coppergate, famed for its connection to the city’s Viking past, derives its name from the old Norse words ‘koppari’ (cupmaker) and ‘gata’ (street), due to the number of woodworkers present there in the Viking era.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_bard_long	The tribal kingdoms of Wales and the Old North always maintained a separate identity from the other peoples with whom they shared the Isles. The Celtic bardic tradition, for example, was one that differed from the Anglo-Saxon one, gradually disappearing from mainland Europe from the start of the Christian era but surviving for several more centuries in Britain. As parts of Wales and the Scottish Lowlands suffered from periodic political and military upheavals throughout the Dark Ages, the shared culture of their peoples remained anchored in the stories and poems of their bards and storytellers. In fact, such was the efficacy of the Welsh bards to their culture that when King Edward I managed to end the rule of the Welsh princes in the thirteenth century, he took additional steps to ensure that their royal bardic tradition would also be abolished. In earlier history, there are a number of notable examples of Brythonic lyric-writing poets of epic verse – Taliesin, for example, who was thought to have been a native of the sixth-century kingdom of Powys, and had several poems attributed to him in works compiled several hundred years after his death which still survive today.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_gold_long	It was the Romans who first started the industrial processing of gold in Britain, having mined the Dolaucothi deposit in south Wales throughout their occupation. In the early medieval period, the growing kingdoms of the Isles had access to gold-based wealth that may have been obtained locally, since records tell us they were able to pay off successive groups of raiding Vikings with gold coin and artefacts. The exact sources of their gold is unclear, however, since there is little record of the previously Roman-controlled Welsh mines being exploited in the Dark Ages, but some of it was likely obtained in other deposits that existed in Cornwall, Devon, and more further afield in Ireland. More direct evidence of local reserves only emerges in the late medieval period, when the right to work gold-bearing deposits was regularly recited in decrees made by the English Crown from the early fourteenth century onwards.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_lead_long	As with many naturally-occurring metals in Britain, lead was first extracted there on an industrial scale by the Romans. Its corrosion-resistant qualities made it ideal for lining their baths and water pipes, with its Latin name ‘plumbum’ being the etymology for the English word ‘plumber’. In Saxon-era England, records show that lead was extracted and transported all over the country, travelling as far as mines in Derbyshire all the way south to Kent. The Viking bullion economy also depended on lead weights, a common archaeological find in Viking hoards and in areas known to have been commercial centres in the Viking settlement period, since the accurate weighing of precious metals such as silver and gold was critical to fair and accurate transactions. Additionally, lead facilitated the manufacture of stained glass, a common feature of the churches of the day. By adding it to glass mixtures, it lowered the melting points for less resource-intensive glass production.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_moot_hill_long	In order to effectively delegate extensive jurisdiction over large areas of land in early medieval societies, congregation places were needed where those with recognised legal rights could gather and dispense law. Thought to be originally used by the Saxons as a kind of ancient Germanic general assembly, a moot hill, or ‘mons placiti’, was a particular type of congregation place that often – but not always – took the form of an actual hill, or some other naturally occurring feature. It was in these places that local people settled their business as well as being where proclamations were read, and most importantly, where many court cases were argued and decided upon. The use of hills likely came from the presence of burial mounds near most settlement areas where people lived in larger groups, as these places were seen as sacred or hallow ground, but other locations would have been purpose-built.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_port_herring_long	Fish bone evidence gathered from around the Scottish coast indicates that marine-based subsistence quadrupled there in the early Middle Ages, coinciding with the time of increased Viking settlement in the 8th century. Herring was one of the most common catches of the era for the new settlers, and had been a valuable maritime resource to the Gaels and Picts who were already inhabiting the area before their arrival. The beauty of herring was that it could be gathered easily, simply by casting off in a small boat and scooping large shoals directly out of coastal waters. This process was done on a much larger scale as human populations increased, especially considering the impact of the swelling inland communities on freshwater ecosystems of river fish. The Vikings likely imported their own superior fishing techniques to cultivate the plentiful herring, such as the use of different forms of driftnets and foreshore weirs to trap them with the outgoing tides, thus contributing to the flourishing herring markets of the era.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_tithe_hall_long	Originally expounded in ecclesiastical law, tithing was the debt of lay people to make obligatory contributions of money or supplies to the church. Although such systems started out as religious charters in biblical times, by the 8th century they had started to be enforced in many places within Europe by secular laws. The main purpose for tithing systems was to support the clergy, maintain churches, assist the poor, and provide subsidy to construct many of the grand buildings associated with religious worship like cathedrals. Although tithe contributions were sometimes made in the form of monetary payments, agricultural societies like Britain in the Middle Ages often paid the equivalent in crop yields, farm stock, or other consumable goods. Tithe barns, where such contributions were stored, were often sizeable buildings – all farms and manorial systems under the tithing laws of a land had to contribute, so there was a lot of supplies to have to store.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_farm_long	Farming not only dictated the daily roles of the individuals who had made their home on the British Isles in the early Middle Ages, but also defined the passage of time for them in terms of the agricultural seasons through which they lived. The eighth-century historian Bede painted a picture of fertile lands of variety and abundance, that had long been farmed by myriad settlers throughout the ages. Farming space, or lack of it in the Scandinavian context, is thought to be one of the motivations for Viking migration to Britain, as it was known that there was an increasing population in areas such as Jutland and Norway at the time. Some historical records also mention a type of lottery practiced by the Northmen thought to have been intended to help prevent excessive strain on agriculture in their homelands due to overcrowding, with the losers exiled to find a new life of subsistence abroad.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_mill_long	Before the advent of industrial mechanisation and electricity, harnessing the natural strength of water was an extremely effective method of generating energy for industry and agriculture. Water wheels and mills were first used in ancient Rome and India, and by the end of the 10th century there were several thousand mills harnessing the power of water across Europe. Using the power of streams or rivers by catching heads of water in paddles, watermills transform kinetic energy into rotational energy at a gearhouse. This, in turn, works the pestle and mortar mechanisms used to grind and mash grain. The basic principle of watermills has never changed, though the machinery itself differed depending on where they were built – for instance, 'tide mills' at coastal settlements employed the same method of energy generation, but used the rising and falling motion of the tides to power their mechanisms.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_offas_hall_long	King Offa was one of the most renowned kings of the Anglo-Saxon era. He ruled over Mercia in the second half of the 8th century and famously brought a large part of England south of Yorkshire under the highest level of Saxon political unification ever seen. An expansionist ruler, Offa clashed with the Saxons of Wessex during his efforts to ruthlessly suppress resistance from anyone who opposed his single, powerful Mercian state. He was less concerned with uniting the people of the Anglo-Saxon cultural sphere, and more motivated by the protection and expansion of his own kingdom. His protectionist efforts are famously represented by the remnants of Offa’s Dyke, the great linear earthwork constructed to defend his kingdom from the Welsh groups to the west. Offa’s aspirations for power, however, were more lavishly symbolised by the coinage on which he appeared, as well as the Great Hall in Tamworth from which he ruled – a grand structure built as an improvement on the royal hall of King Creoda, the fabled inaugural ruler of Mercia thought to have lived around two hundred years earlier.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_iron_long	Iron’s versatility and availability made it very popular throughout the ancient and medieval worlds. By the end of the bronze age, many uses had been found for copper alloys, but with the discovery of iron smelting processes, a whole new range of products started to be manufactured. It is one of the most common elements on earth and used to create steel, one of the hardest substances on earth, simply by adding carbon impurities to it. Historically, the incredible durability of steel made iron a vital ingredient for the production of tools and weapons, driving war and industry throughout the past in many parts of the world. In the context of the British Isles, iron weaponry and armour were likely treasured by the warriors of the early medieval period, with martial artefacts commonly passed between generations, and some grave-finds identified as having been circulated for a century or more before being buried with their final owners.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_rock_caisil_long	The Rock of Caisil is a curious landmark – a seemingly out-of-place limestone hill mysteriously situated on the flatlands of Tipperary, Ireland, upon which ancient fortresses and castles stood at various points throughout history. The site is associated with Saint Patrick, who was said to have banished Satan himself from a mountain cave located 30 kilometres away resulting in the furious demon biting off a piece of the mountain, breaking a tooth, and spitting the rock out to its resting place in Tipperary. In reality the hill probably existed before Saint Patrick’s time, since history also relates that the ruling Eóganacht dynasty of Munster constructed a stronghold upon it as early as the 4th century. This probably gave the location its name, since ‘Caisil’ in Old Gaelic translates to ‘stone fort’. Demon-banishing legends aside, the rock is also known to be where Saint Patrick converted and christened the 'King of Munster' at the time in around AD 450, a key event in the spreading of Christianity in Ireland. From the conversion of this dynasty there, the hill site remained an important power base in the following centuries, acting as the king's seat up until the Norman invasion.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_tin_long	Tin is a key ingredient of bronze, and despite the bronze age having long been over by the beginning of the Christian era, bronze’s resistance to rust compared to ferrous metals meant it always remained an important and valuable material with a multitude of applications. Due to the rarity of tin in Europe, wherever streams were present it was always very profitable for those who controlled them. In fact, abundant tin deposits are thought to be the reason why Cornwall and Devon suffered successive invasions in late antiquity and later centuries. The Romans, for example, initially occupied areas of mainland Britain further east, with tin production almost certainly the main reason why they ventured into the southwestern Celtic kingdom of Dumnonia at the time. Centuries later, as the region was dominating the European market for the resource, control of its output was thought to be the motive for the eventual Anglo-Saxon expansion into the area.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_salt_long	Salt was vitally important for its use in the preservation of fish and meat throughout the medieval period, when it was mostly obtained from salt pans in coastal areas and royally designated ‘salt districts’. Early records highlight the significance of saltworks to Anglo-Saxon kings, with the 11th century Domesday book listing up to 285 salt pans in Sussex alone. Royal charters from before that time already mention salt production as an important function for some royal estates, where kings of the era were known to have made provisions for the appropriate facilities wherever the resource was available. The Vikings, known to have been quite fond of meat, were undoubtedly also familiar with food preservation techniques, but may have used curdled milk as a preservative rather than salt. With Britain’s extensive history in salt production, however, they likely switched to salt-curing processes to take advantage of the more effective local resource of their newly-settled land.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_mint_long	The increase in power centralisation in early medieval England inevitably meant that rulers gained a wider reach to administer and intervene in the daily life of the ruled. This was exemplified not only in the creation of towns during the period, but also the production and use of coinage. Legitimised, emblazoned wealth with clearly definable value was useful for many reasons, enabling kings to draw income from several sources from across his lands – things like tributes, tolls, fines, and forfeitures incurred in the law courts, with paid coinage typically presided over by royal reeves. By the end of the 9th century, there were a few mints located in the most secure royal centres in Britain. The most astute rulers divided their royal income into fractions earmarked for special purposes, an undertaking which would have been impossible without coinage systems run by educated men.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_master_forge_long	As the economy of Anglo-Saxon England experienced changes and advancements between the late 7th and mid-9th centuries, the Mercian kings demonstrated a notable ability to harness the various sources of wealth in the land to increase their own power. Such wealth is perhaps no more evident anywhere else as in the findings observed in the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork ever found. The artefacts date back to the seventh or eighth century, with their location placing them right in the period of the Kingdom of Mercia. Although metalworking had a pragmatic place in Anglo-Saxon society, the findings in the hoard are almost exclusively martial in character, with a notably high level of workmanship. For the Mercians, weaponry was clearly used symbolically as well as practically – an indication of status both on and off the battlefield. As such, Mercian weapons would have partly been the product of the blacksmith, and partly that of the goldsmith or jeweller.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_round_tower_long	During the Dark Ages, many tall, round-tower structures were constructed in northern parts of the British Isles and Ireland. Known as ‘brochs’ in Scotland, and ‘cloigtheach’ in Ireland, the reasons for their construction are not always clear, but their names give clues as to their purpose. ‘Broch’ has its roots in the word ‘brough’, a lowland word for fort and similar in meaning to the Germanic ‘burg’ and ‘borough’, while ‘Cloigtheach’ means ‘bell house’. This, along with the clusters of village buildings at their feet, indicates that these towers were intended for both defensive and public order purposes. With some towers being up to forty metres high, they enabled a 360-degree view of the surrounding land and therefore any approaching forces, with entrance doors that were usually several feet up and accessible with a ladder which could be raised or lowered, or postholes into which wooden steps could be inserted for the same purpose. Rooms within the towers were generally positioned inside a second wall, with stairs between the two to give access to the upper levels. This made them very secure and therefore a likely place to keep valuables safe from marauding raiders.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_nunnaminster_long	Although the war with the Vikings had taken much out of King Alfred and his West Saxon kingdom, the venerable monarch was tireless in his efforts to set about restoring society by promoting learning, order, and peace within his kingdom. Part of those efforts was his reinstitution of the church’s influence and importance, and he did so by setting up two new religious houses in Winchester – a new monastery for monks known as New Minster, and an abbey for nuns known as the nun’s minster or ‘Nunnaminster’. Ran under Benedictine rule, it was closely connected to the royal household and was one of the foremost centres of learning and art in southern England of the Dark Ages. In its original form, the nunnery was a double-domed wooden structure that was eventually rebuilt in stone like other religious buildings of its type in the era. It sat in isolation from the growing city of Winchester within a single enclosure that covered an extensive area, also containing the newly-built New Minster, as well as the older Anglo-Saxon cathedral known as Old Minster.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_scoan_abbey_long	Old Scone was one of the noteworthy ancient capitals of the Pictish kingdoms, the rulers of which presided over the constantly shifting dominions of the north. With the spread of Christianity in the Dark Ages, Scone became a notable location for the early Christian church in Scotland. It was there that an Augustinian monastery known as Scone Priory was founded, which eventually became an Abbot’s residence, and later on encompassed the grounds of the chief residence of Scottish kings, Scone Palace. For many years before it housed royalty, however, the abbey at Scone had been an important venue. It stood opposite an old Moot Hill that acted as a famous coronation site of numerous ancient kings, and at one point was home to the mysterious ‘Stone of Destiny’, a holy relic also known as ‘The Stone of Scone’. A pale rectangular block of sandstone weighing around 152kg, Scottish kings would sit on it during coronation ceremonies as part of an old tradition practiced in Ireland and Scotland since ancient times. The Stone of Destiny was used to enthrone Scottish monarchs at Iona and Dunadd before being used at Scone, and is considered a powerful living symbol of Scottish nationalism.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_court_school_long	By the time of King Alfred the Great’s treaty with Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, the war had already taken much out of Alfred’s West Saxon kingdom. Even so, the venerable monarch was nevertheless tireless in his efforts to set about restoring society by promoting learning, order, and peace within his kingdom. For Alfred, the greatest failing of his peoples was their laziness in pursuing wisdom and promoting education, so to address this perceived problem he gathered court scholars from around Britain and the continent to revive learning in his kingdom. Central to his reforms was the idea that education was not just an obligation for the clergy or monks, as was the case at the time, but for all those who served in his court. Convinced that the exercising of power had to have the precondition of wisdom, he cajoled and threatened his nobles with dismissal if they did not learn how to read – an extraordinary demand in a time when most men had likely been illiterate since childhood. Almost immediately, his ealdormen and thegns did as he requested, such was their unwillingness to otherwise relinquish their offices of power.	true

building_description_texts_long_description_vik_port_fish_long	The effectiveness of early ship development of the various groups vying for power in Viking-era Britain arguably shaped its destiny. Even before King Alfred’s foundation of what is considered the first large-scale royal navy in the 9th century, the inhabitants of the Isles would have long been able seafarers for the purposes of commerce, fishing, and faster travel. As with other areas of innovation, ship designs often took on external influences out of necessity, but that was not the case for everyone. For example, the Saxons were originally settlers from across the sea themselves so had their own techniques, while the Vikings were defined by their superior abilities in shipbuilding from their need to cross vast oceans, sail up rivers, and carry out swift coastal raids. In all cases, however, facilities would always be needed to safely load and unload ships, whether the cargo was tradeable goods, warriors, or just normal travelling folk.	true
building_description_texts_long_description_vik_great_hall_long	By the post-Roman era, most communities on the British Isles had moved away from the tribal hierarchies seen in past centuries and started to be ruled over by fully-fledged kingdoms. Tribal hall buildings remained important meeting places, however, acting as effective arms of governance and dispensation of justice. They were also the assembly places for groups like guilds, religious orders, and ‘tithings’, that is, groups of kinsmen or unrelated freemen who acted as sureties for one another's behaviour. Saxon and Viking poetry often alludes to the ‘joys of the hall’, a clear reference to the feasting and drinking that often took place before or after battles. This also served a quasi-political purpose, as successful kings did not only attract men to their service solely by being courageous warriors or effective rulers – the faithful would share in their leaders’ revelries in return for being eternally prepared to fight and die for them in times of war.	true

building_flavour_texts_flavour_rom_PLACEHOLDER	[PLACEHOLDER – DO NOT TRANSLATE] that earned Canterbury industrial prosperity at various points in its past, and history tells us that an older tradition of embroidery actually existed there as far back as the Dark Ages. A building that still stands in the city today known as ‘The Old Weavers’ House’ was where the Canterbury weavers of the sixteenth century gained their fame, but part of the structure is believed to date back to around the Anglo-Saxon era when the town was known as 'Cantwaraburg', and was a likely location for the production of Opus Anglicanum, or ‘English Work’. This medieval custom of decadent embroidery made use of gold thread, carried out by highly-skilled professionals who would take up to seven years to perfect their craft. The resulting work was unequalled in craftsmanship anywhere else in Europe at the time, resulting in much sought-after fabrics commonly donned as ceremonial clothing by royalty or the clergy, but also used for decorative purposes like the famous example of the Bayeux Embroidery. Another existing specimen is the gold and silk embroidery which drapes the reliquary coffin containing the relics of Saint Cuthbert in Durham Cathedral, identified as being West Saxon Opus Anglicanum work of the tenth century.	true

deployables_description_deployable_brimstone	Brimstone (sulphur) and bitumen, amongst other things, can be composited to create a highly dangerous weapon. Bitumen helps a slow-burning brimstone composite stick to things, especially men and mounts, causing severe burns if not death. In addition to fire arrows, the mixture can also be poured from towers during sieges. A brimstone pit can be deployed before a battle begins and ignited when an enemy charge is underway, ideally too late for it to be aborted.	true

deployables_description_deployable_caltrop	Sudes are an extremely versatile weapon. Due to the nature of their construction they can be placed in the ground to create low palisades or interlocked to create a caltrop shape. In caltrop form, sudes can kill charging/running units from either direction (something that stakes cannot).	true

deployables_tooltip_deployable_stakes	Stakes cause damage to mounted units approaching from the front. They cause extra damage if the unit is moving quickly.	true
deployables_description_deployable_fireball	Rocks, logs and hay bales can be set alight and used to disrupt battlelines prior to an attack or weaken the morale of the defenders. Objects can doused in pitch, brimstone, resin, sap, etc. depending on the desired effect. These deployable items are best used in ambush situations and/or on undulating terrain.	true
deployables_name_deployable_fireball	Fireballs	true
deployables_description_deployable_sharp_stones	Sharp stone beds are created from various types of stone, constructed as a form of non-lethal defence around settlements. Stones can either sunk into the ground or layed in irregular piles. Infantry find these difficult objects to traverse, whereas cavalry can only pass through by picking routes between the stones. This slowing effect produces an effective killing zone in and around the stones, ideal ground for missile units to trap their targets.	true
deployables_tooltip_deployable_fireball	Fireballs roll downhill and cause great damage to all units in their path. They can be activated by clicking on a unit and then on a fireball.\\n\\nUnits must be in melee mode to activate fireballs.	true
deployables_description_deployable_stakes	Wooden stakes are one  of the most common settlement defences. A simple yet effective device, sharpened stakes are set in 45 degree lines to impale charging men or horses. They can easily be navigated around when moving slowly, but even this can be used to the advantage of missile units. Stakes angled this way can also enable defenders to sally forth without the risk of impalement.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_1	You have a small amount of unallocated coin in your coffers. Whilst you could just leave it there, the army is always in need of more funds. Or you could reward the people for their loyalty and mundane toil. Then there are the nobles, who are always happy to take money in return for their invaluable advice. What will you do?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_3	As a ruler, there are many burdens on your time - and on your coffers. The treasury looks moderately healthy at the moment, thanks to recent successes, but will you keep all your coin or redistribute a little of it? And if you do choose to spend some money, who should reap the benefit?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_2	Your funds are growing. They could continue to grow, safe in your vaults, and the thought of that does give you a pleasant, warm feeling. But, say the advisors of your Witan, maybe the money should be put to work, used to build up your armies or keep people happy - or even, they humbly suggest, spent on them.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_5	Your Witan, nobles who act as advisors and - they claim - as a moderating force to remind you of your obligations, say that you have enough gold in hand to spend some. They are no doubt hoping you will spend it on them, but you could give more funding to the army instead, or favour the people with your generosity - assuming you wish to spend anything at all.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_4	You have enough in your treasury that you could, if you wish, spend a bit. Causes which spring to mind are the army, forever in need to more recruits, training and equipment, and the people who till the land and whose goodwill must be cultivated - as must that of your nobles. Who will you choose?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_7	After attending mass it occurs to you that one way of showing your calibre as a great Christian ruler would be by spending a little of your fortune. Not on the church - they have plenty - but perhaps on the nobles of your Witan. Then again, they are not exactly poor either, so perhaps you should invest in the army, or reward the common people for their unending labours. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_6	Your favourable finances give you leeway to spend. On whom, though? Predictably, your Witan suggest a payment to the nobility. But the army would benefit from more funding too. And you should not forget the peasants who produce the food you eat, as without them you have no kingdom.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_9	Given how rich you are these days, you should probably be seen to spread a little wealth, investing in areas which will bring long-term benefit. The army is always asking for more money - as are the noble advisors of your Witan. Then there are the commoners, who would rejoice at such unexpected beneficence.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_8	One of the joys of being a successful ruler is being able to decide who to indulge and encourage. You have sufficient spare funds to put on a feast for the people, or maybe to outfit a new army unit. Or you could spend money to keep your nobles sweet.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_east_2	Your fleet has reached the wooded coastline of the lands of the Rus. The people here, who may have been kin to your folk in the distant past, are taciturn but not openly hostile. They may be amenable to trade. Or do you wish the expedition to carry on to see what lies farther east?	true

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_east_1	The crossing was hard, with high seas and bitter winds, but the promise of the riches of the East drew the expedition on.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_east_6	Beyond the lands of the Bulgari, the expedition comes to Khazaria. The Khazars are a confederation of several races, although they worship a single god. They are settled and civilised, with well-tilled fields and vineyards, and gardens which they cultivate for pleasure rather than utility. They have wide-reaching trade links in every direction.  	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_east_7	Your expedition crosses a great inland sea that bounds Khazaria, and spends several days out of sight of land. On the far side the fleet finds Gorgan, the City of Towers. The climate is warm here and the fields are rich; as well as familiar crops like wheat and grapes the locals grow brightly coloured, astringent fruits. Artisans in the city craft colourful, intricately-designed rugs and fine pottery.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_east_4	The rivers of the east are wide and slow. Your expedition use these inland routes to travel deep into the heart of the eastern lands, though they soon face a choice of direction.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_east_5	Beyond the coastal forests your expedition enters a land of endless grassy plains and open skies. Though the people who live here were once nomads, some of them have now settled along the banks of the river. They are savage and warlike but also canny traders.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_east_8	The southern river path brings your expedition to a settlement on a small hill, at the meeting point of many trade routes. The fortified city of Kyjev holds riches from all four corners of the world. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_east_9	Your expedition reaches the greatest city of them all - Constantinople.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_mide_fair_ask_to_hold_1	The annual fair is a major undertaking; land must be put aside, performers booked, contests organised and massive amounts of food and drink laid on.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_mide_fair_ask_to_hold_2	You need to decide whether or not to hold the Fair of Tailtiu this year. It is always a popular celebration, with attendees coming from across Eriu, but it is also a costly event to stage, and your coffers will be depleted by it.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_10	After an unsettled night, perhaps brought on by an excess of cheese and roast meats, you wake feeling uneasy. You dreamt of swimming through a sea of gold while tormented by distant cries of distress from the shore. Perhaps this is an omen, and you should give away some of the considerable funds you have accumulated. Who to, though?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_11	With this much spare cash in hand, you can afford to be generous. Not that you have to, but if you do choose the magnanimous path and open your coffers then you have the chance to make a huge difference.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_8	To put your stamp on this land, you plan to start minting your own currency. It will be a new design, with its value and the name of the land on the back. But what should you put on the front of the new coin? Your folk would be happy to see your head gracing it, but might this be a step too far for those you have conquered, who would no doubt prefer a cross or suchlike.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_9	Between a good harvest and some canny trading, you have a small surplus of grain. Do you wish this to go to your army in order to feed up your warriors? Or could distributing the grain be a way of gaining favour with the English you have conquered, showing that you can be a generous ruler.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_2	Well done on your recent victory! To commemorate this great triumph, you have the chance to spend some of your gold on those who serve you. But should your generosity reach the army who fight for you, or the English people over whom you rule?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_3	The treasury is looking somewhat empty. You must make any choices to spend with care, and decide who is most worthy to receive what little you have. The question is, should the army get some small boost, or are the people your priority?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_1	Your coffers are groaning. As a result you have the chance to show favour to those who you believe are most worth it. But your resources are not finite, so you must prioritise. Do you wish your largess to benefit your army or be given to the English people?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_6	You have managed to get hold of a large shipment of quality iron ingots from mines on the continent. Your first thought is to use it to equip your army by providing new, quality arms and armour. But the English peasants who till the land could also put the iron to good use, making better equipment to work their fields with.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_7	You are settling into rulership of these lands, and must think of mundane matters of government. When you need to set up meetings between different interests coming from far afield these had best occur on neutral ground. But where? Your warriors wish to use old battlefields as meeting places, to remind those who live here who rules them now. But the English will not like this, and would prefer meeting at the old sites they have always used.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_4	It is your people's way to commemorate great deeds by erecting stones carved with runes and images, in order that their heroic actions may be known to future generations. The English frown on this practice, calling it heathen and primitive. They favour recording everything on paper. Books are cheaper than stone, but they are also more perishable - and who reads them? 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_5	You feel secure enough to invest some of your gold in improvements to the land you now rule. But should you think first of your troops, and improve the old roads your army uses to move around? Or should you look to the English farmers who provide your food, and drain some of the fens to give them more land to cultivate?	true

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_6	You ships reach the lands at the far western end of the Iberian peninsula. The coast shows a face of high cliffs cut into by flooded river valleys. One of the rockiest sections is protected by a towering lighthouse built by the Romans.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_7	The winds are with your ships, blowing them around the Iberian peninsula to its western coast, a land originally settled by the same people who live in Gallaecia. The Romans called them the Cales, and had trouble subduing them. More recently they have been living under the rule of Moorish invaders, though they have now regained some autonomy. Their main settlement is a prosperous port on the mouth of a wide river.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_4	This land of mists and menhirs has much to offer, from lush pastures and orchards to seas rich with fish. Its people are as ancient as its stones, and have little time for their Frankish neighbours. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_5	After crossing the stormy Basque Sea, your expedition sights the rocky northern coast of Iberia, the western peninsula that marks the end of the known world. The people here are proud and fierce, but could still serve as vassals if that is your command. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_2	Your ships reach the north-west coast of the Frankish territories, the land of Neustria. The countryside is good and fertile, and is dotted with churches and abbeys whose walls conceal considerable wealth.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_3	Your expedition reaches the northern Frankish lands. Much of the coast here rises in great white cliffs, sisters to those on the coast of Britannia across the water. This is also the place where the great River Seine reaches the sea. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_1	The crossing was rough, but your expedition has won through to the many and varied lands of the south. Will they carry on farther south, either by sea or up-river? 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_8	Your expedition reaches the greatest settlement of the Frankish territories. Named for the Parisii tribe who originally settled on an isle in the River Seine, the town was fortified by the Romans and has since grown into a populous city and spread out along the river's banks, though the heart of it remains the fortified isle.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_9	The river takes your ships deep into Frankish territory, and they find a fortified city beside the river. Orlians lies in the heartland of the Franks, and is second only to Paris amongst their settlements. They make good wine, and items from many distant lands are traded here.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_fact_gwined_dilemma_sea_kings_1	For too long the coast of Wales has been harassed by the 'Viking Sea Kings'. Now, our people have had enough and demand that we do something about them. What should we do?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_fact_gwined_dilemma_sea_kings_2	The Vikings continue to menace the seas even though we have paid the tribute they demanded! We have to do something, but what?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_river_battle_1	As your ships follow the course of the river they are set upon by enemies. Will your warriors flee these foes, or stay and engage them?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_river_battle_3	Your expedition overcame the foes who attacked them on the river, but the victory was hard won. Many of your warriors were slain today. Will you take this as a sign from the gods to retreat or will you tell the remainder of your men to land?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_river_battle_2	Your enemies miscalculated when they attacked your expedition. Your warriors are at home on any water, be it at sea or on the river, and they vanquish the enemy. With this triumph under their belts, would you have the men land here, or press on?	true

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_10	As the river approaches the Frankish highlands, your expedition comes across a large and prosperous town, built on a great promontory and defended by thick walls. It has an impressive Christian abbey, and is also at a crossroads for trade. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_westsexa_dilemma_1	You call the Witan together to discuss the state of the army. The nobles who make up the Witan have a wide range of experience, and include former military commanders as well as administrators used to managing the coffers. With limited resources, it is important to decide on future priorities for your fighting forces.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_westsexa_dilemma_2	Too many battles have not gone in your favour recently. The Witan, nobles fond of discussing matters at great length, have many theories as to why this may be. One thing they do agree on is that you need a plan to make your army more effective in future.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_westsexa_dilemma_3	Rumours of muttering amongst the peasantry reach your ears. You summon the Witan to consider what might be done to head off future unrest. Your noble advisors come up with a number of possible courses of action to keep the people healthy, wealthy and happy - though not necessarily all three at once.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_westsexa_dilemma_4	The villages are ailing. Reports claim that in some places the peasants are not putting their all into their work. The Witan, with their wide experience of ruling and guiding the lower classes, will help you decide how best to address this.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_westsexa_dilemma_5	Many factors must be considered when planning for the future. The Witan, nobles who have wide and varied experience both in the church and in society as a whole, have much good advice to give on how best to prioritise in coming days. Ultimately, of course, the choice of what to do comes down to you.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_12	Once you have conquered, you must rule. Your council of advisors, known as your Thing, are essential for this. But now you are ruling over a foreign people, and they would like a say too. Should you ignore the mewling of the English and rule as you always have, or should you include some of those you have conquered in your future counsels, perhaps even admitting foreigners to the Thing? 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_13	Now they have decided to settle in this land, your warriors would appreciate having access to the comforts they were accustomed to in their old home. They would like you to build a great hall where they can feast and tell tales of past battles. But you have also had a delegation from the English, saying they need more churches; their priests even imply that to not build churches would show that you only pay lip-service to their beliefs. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_10	You have captured a murderer who has committed many heinous crimes. Your warriors say there was never one more deserving of death, perhaps even the excruciating death of the Blood Eagle. However, by English tradition a trial must be held, and the execution, whilst inevitable, must be carried out according to local law. Should you use your people's traditions, or those of the people you now rule?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_11	Just as the incomers who became the English did, you now have a chance to fortify and dig in the territory you now rule. However, time and resources are limited. Should you concentrate on making your old over-wintering camps even more defensible, or should you do as the people of the land would wish, and erect defences to protect their growing settlements? 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_viking_dilemma_14	In this new land, with your people ruling those who were here before, you will need new laws. The question is, should these be the laws of your people, a nation of warriors, or should they be the laws that these pious English farmers have been used to living by? 	true

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_convert_religion_1	Missionaries have arrived in your lands, eager for converts. Will you listen to their message, or ignore the 'good news' they bring in favour of continuing the old ways?  Your armies do not wish to convert and your continued refusal would make them grow ever stronger. But the missionaries are appealing to the people; under this new belief system they would become more content with their lot and easier to rule. Or perhaps a middle path may be possible; you could convert but leave everyone else to make their own choice. Yet choose with care: once you are baptised into the faith of Jesu, there is no turning back.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_convert_religion_3	Your priests are not happy at the continued presence of the missionaries of the new religion. They urge you to ignore the upstarts' message and honour your warriors to strengthen the army's power. The people have accepted the way things are for generations; any minor unrest from them now will be a passing irritation. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_convert_religion_2	Copies of the new religion's sacred book are turning up all over the place. Although you are not a people renowned for your love of books, the message within finds favour with the commoners.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_convert_religion_5	This Jesu appears popular with the commoners; a conversion movement would go down very well with them, making them more... tractable. The army, on the other hand, cannot see the point of fighting for a god some people call the 'prince of peace'. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_convert_religion_4	Some at your court are asking whether there is perhaps something in the message of this new god; some say the signs indicate his is the true way., whereas others claim to have had portentous dreams. Are they weak, reacting to the whims of the people? Or is there good reason to convert to the new religion now?	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_convert_religion_6	One can say this for the priests of the new god: they don't give up easily. You have refused their message many times, yet still they preach and pray and read their holy books. Should you take this to indicate that they are in the right, as the people have come to believe, or should you side with your warriors; after all, the missionaries must give up soon, surely?	true

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_9	On the confluence of three rivers your expedition finds a settlement known as Leipsic, the town of the lime trees. This location is on the intersection of two ancient routes, the north-south Via Imperii, or Imperial Highway, and the east-west Via Regia, the King's Highway.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_2	The marshes and low islets of the coast of Saxland have been home to fisher-folk and farmers for as long as anyone remembers.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_north_4	In the far, cold reaches of the north, you have discovered a new land. Although snow covers its heart all year there is some usable territory along the sheltered fjords of its western coast. Perhaps it may one day be farmed by your hardy folk? The expedition optimistically names it 'Greenland'.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_3	A little way up the wide estuary of the River Elfr your expedition comes across a new settlement near a bend in the river.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_6	Your ships have travelled many days to get here, passing through the Pillars of Hercules into the warm Middle Sea to reach the land of the Langobards.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_7	Your expedition travelled far, circling the coast of Iberia to gain access to the warm waters of the Middle Sea, once the heartland of the Roman Empire.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_north_3	The expedition reaches your colony in Iceland. The settlers of 'Smoky Bay', with its hot springs and good fishing, have sufficient provisions to offer fresh supplies.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_4	Your ships make landfall in the rich lowlands of Friesland. Though much of Friesland is marsh, the city of Groningen lies in good agricultural country, where they grow rye, oats and barley; the locals also make fine, pale beer.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_north_2	Your fleet has found a new and unclaimed land in the north. It is a place of snow and ice, though it also has fire in its heart. Your men name it 'Iceland', as perhaps a name like that will discourage others who may want to settle here and claim what little farmland is available.	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_5	Your fleet reaches Dorestad, a port on the sheltered coast of Friesland. Once a thriving market-place whose fame spread far and wide, Dorestad has gone into decline in recent years, and occupies what is now disputed territory.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_1_1	You have a small amount of unallocated coin in your coffers. Whilst you could just leave it there, the army is always in need of more funds.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_2_1	Your funds are growing. They could continue to grow, safe in your vaults, and the thought of that does give you a pleasant, warm feeling.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_6_1	Your favourable finances give you leeway to spend. On whom, though? Predictably, your Witan suggest a payment to the nobility.

dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_7_1	After attending mass it occurs to you that one way of showing your calibre as a great Christian ruler would be by spending a little of your fortune.

Then again, they are not exactly poor either, so perhaps you should invest in the army, or reward the common people for their unending labours. 	true
dilemmas_localised_description_vik_miercna_treasury_8_1	One of the joys of being a successful ruler is being able to decide who to indulge and encourage.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_characters_abilities_generals	The general has a huge influence on his army’s fortunes in battle, not least because the abilities at his disposal can turn the tide in their favour. You can unlock generals’ abilities and develop them in-line with skills and experience, sometimes upgrading them to become stronger or affect more units. There are three attributes that unlock different categories of general’s ability: “Warrior”, which is unlocked by high zeal; “Commander”, which become available when authority is high; “Strategist”, which is dependent on high cunning. As a general or admiral improves each of his three attributes, he will progressively unlock further abilities.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_controls	Basic Controls	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_controls_compass	The manoeuvre compass is used for fine-tuning orders on the battlefield. The three arrows within its top half can be used to direct a unit or group straight ahead, or turn left or right. The button in the centre of the lower half causes the selected unit to step backwards. Holding down this button will make them turn and walk backwards. Clicking and holding down the rank and file buttons on either side change the depth of a unit's formation by increasing or decreasing the number of rows the troops stand in.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_demolish	Buildings can be demolished if you want to construct something else in their place (or leave nothing of value to an invader if you are about to lose a region to them) by use of the demolish button that appears when you mouse over a building on the settlement panel. Settlements and ports cannot be demolished at their base levels.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_wells	Poison Wells	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_war_declare	The declare war option is used to officially open armed hostilities with another faction, as opposed to simply marching into their territory to stake your claim. Never declare war without first considering the consequences, as an ill-prepared assault could have consequences resulting in your reduction to satrapy or client status, or worse: the annihilation of your faction. Note that when making your declaration the check box asking allies to join you is defaulted to yes. Your allies will assess the situation and may agree to declare war, but might just as easily break off your alliance, leaving you to fend for yourself.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_flanking_melee_double	This variant of the melee double formation arranges its ships two deep in order to smash through the enemy centre to split their formation.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_fleet_access_on	When an army attempts to cross the sea, a transport ship is automatically supplied to provide passage. While these ships are similar to military vessels, they are slower, more cumbersome and are unable to withstand sustained damage. With that in mind, transport ships require the protection of your fleets if they are to transport large armies across the sea. Selecting a fleet and right-clicking on a transport provides an armed escort for the journey: any attacks on the transport will have to face the fleet first. To disembark an army or agent onto land, select its transport ship and right-click on the coast.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_agents_authority	Authority is a measure of the strength of a character’s personality. It is the ability to get things done in their particular field, and also resist authoritarian agent actions. For agents, high authority reduces the cost of their actions; for generals, it increases their radius of influence and unlocks the "commander" set of abilities.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_army_fragments_replenish	Unit Replenishment	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_ignore	Battlefield movement speed penalties are ignored by any unit with this attribute.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions_divorce	This action is the same as the one above, except that it has no financial cost and a high political cost. Carrying out this action means losing the support of more patricians than would be the case by just killing her. It also has a small negative effect on the target character’s gravitas.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_frenzy	This ability improves both attacking and charging capabilities, but reduces defensive capabilities for a short time and leaves the unit fatigued for a time afterwards.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_parties	Depending on your chosen faction, the total number of political parties ranges from two to four. Note that only Rome and Carthage have multi-family politics – that is, their political parties are divided between two or more groups representing specific houses. The choice of which Roman or Carthaginian house to control is made on the faction selection screen immediately prior to beginning a campaign, with each dynasty having their own faction-wide effects. Other than these two cases, there is only the ruling party and one opposition party per faction. Throughout the campaign you must manage your party’s influence in relation to the others such as the Senate, court or tribal council. However, controlling the balance of political power is more challenging when influence has to be maintained between more than two parties, as is the case for Rome and Carthage. Therefore, players unfamiliar with the politics system might wish to play as another faction to begin with, for which the balance only has to be kept between the ruling party and one opposition group.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_intro_formations	Each of these formations enables the effective implementation of a tactic, instantly forming up your army or fleet to maximise its strengths or exploit a weakness in the enemy.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_action_points	Each turn every character has a number of action points allotted to them. Every move, from the distance they travel, to the stance they adopt, to which actions they can take, costs action points. When they have been exhausted it is not possible to do anything else with that particular character until the beginning of the next turn.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_trade	Trade between regions and other factions is vital to economic development and prosperity. A province automatically receives trade wealth based on its constituent buildings. Some regions are rich in resources, valuable trade goods with prices that vary depending on supply and demand at any given time. Factions trade both goods and resources, so trade agreements made through diplomacy enable profitable trade routes to other factions.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_arson	Your spy inflicts considerable damage to a single building within a target settlement. Targeting gates will open them in preparation for a siege attack, whilst sabotaging a port will inflict minor attrition damage to any garrisoned fleet. The success of this agent action is dependent on the spy’s zeal and any skills, traits and household members or objects they may have.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_campaign_action_points	Action Points	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_guerrilla	Your champion’s presence reduces public order in the target province.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_trade_panel	Your global economy is also managed via the trade & finance panel. It shows a summary of your projected income, maps the effect that the current tax rate is having on public order and wealth, and allows the adjustment of tax levels globally for every region under your control. It is also possible to exempt a region from taxation here, should you need a temporary fix to a public order problem. Also displayed is information about how your resources are exported to your trade partners together with the profit made from each of them. Also shown are those resources you have gained from your trade partners and those you have yet to acquire.	true

They work rather like character traits or household members or objects in that they give useful effects. There is a power cost associated with cursus honorum, meaning they can be used to placate useful but potentially dangerous individuals.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_battle_siege_weapons	Siege artillery pieces, such as onagers, can be recruited in the same manner as other units. However, siege engines are constructed on-site and deployed when assaulting a settlement, taking a number of turns to complete before they can be used for an attack. Ranging from simple battering rams to hulking siege towers, they directly connect with enemy walls, but are heavy, slow moving and vulnerable to attack. As such, it’s advisable to escort them lest the enemy sally out to meet their besiegers. The following siege equipment is available, depending on the research of any pre-requisite technology:	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_wells	Your spy uses cunning to poison the wells in the target province, causing damage to all units within its local garrison. This also reduces the settlement’s ability to hold out when under siege. The success of this agent action is dependent on the spy’s cunning and any skills, traits and household members or objects they may have.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_blade	Concealed Blade	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_wealth_income	First and foremost, the amount of income from wealth depends on the tax rate. At the normal tax rate all wealth comes from taxes. At the lower tax rate you get 20% less income than at the normal tax rate, meaning if a province produces 100 wealth, 80 of that would be income. In the same way as wealth, tax rates can also be modified by characters or technologies. This means that a tax rate of -16% could be due to low taxes (-20%) and the presence of a character with a trait that increases your tax rate by +4%.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_wreck	Your spy uses zeal to damage baggage and equipment belonging to the target army, temporarily diminishing the quality level of one item for all units within it.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_slaughter	There is no place for subtlety when your champion charges at the target to brutally kill them. His level of zeal, along with the cunning of the target character, will influence the success of this action. Zeal can be increased via the acquisition of skills, character traits, and any household members or objects your agent may have with them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_power	Your party can gain influence by completing missions, winning victories on the battlefield, and through political machinations back home. Generals with some experience can be left to lead your armies and fleets or be granted political office, known as cursus honorum. While offices cause a gradual increase, a successful general provides a major boost to your party’s influence during wartime. Although it can be left to accumulate, influence can also be used to carry out agent actions, such as assassination, aimed at undermining the influence of another party within your faction.\\n\\nInfluence is shared out in percentages amongst the parties displayed on the faction summary tab. This correlates with the amount of support each party has from within the faction, usually from an invisible ‘patrician’ class. These individuals, such as senators, tribal elders, court nobles, vary depending on the culture of the player faction (for example, the support given to the parties of the democratic Hellenistic factions comes from their citizens, rather than a patrician class). In any case, there is always a limited number of these power-granting individuals, and they can only give support to one party at any one time. Therefore, losing or gaining their support results in a change in influence. This is important when deciding whether or not to carry out political actions, as in the short term many of them cost the support of a fixed number of patricians, subjects or citizens. Observe exactly how many support each party by mousing-over the percentages at the top of the faction summary tab. 	true

The spy’s level of authority, along with the zeal of the target character, will influence the success of this action. Authority can be increased by the presence of skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_resources	Resources are the natural elements and manufactured goods present in a region. They can be exploited to your faction’s benefit, so other factions will target your territory if they wish to obtain resources they do not currently have access to. Since each region contains different resources, some more valuable than others, so it is wise to keep an army nearby to protect them.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions	Maintaining political stability is about making sure total levels of gravitas are at comparable levels between parties. In order to help achieve or maintain this balance there are various political actions available, most of which incur a financial or political cost, or both. The political cost is always a loss of support from a few individuals in the patrician class, which in turn immediately affects your party’s share of influence. However, these actions can affect influence levels in the long term; if attempts to manipulate gravitas are successful there will be favourable changes over successive turns.\\n\\nClicking on a character’s portrait on the faction summary tab reveals the UI with which to carry out these actions, the costs of which are displayed on their respective tooltips. Not all characters can be targeted with all actions; only valid actions will be displayed for each of them. The possible actions are as follows:	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_trample	This ability improves a heavy cavalry unit's charge for an extended period of time.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_siege_defence	Whilst your armies protect threatened regions, your settlements have their own local garrisons to act as rudimentary defence forces. These men are stationed within a settlement and cannot leave their posts to join your armies on campaign. The types of garrison troops available depend on the buildings constructed in a particular settlement. Whilst not the most skilled soldiers, garrisons who defend against besieging forces will develop strength and experience over time. Ports have an equivalent garrison navy to protect against raids and naval blockades.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions_rumours	Spreading rumours discredits a target character, causing him to be held in lesser regard. This action causes his gravitas to be reduced, the financial cost of which increases depending on his original gravitas level.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_phase	The deployment phase is the period of time between arriving on a battlefield and the start of the battle itself, where you can arrange your units into the formation of your choice. The enemy general will deploy his men within the opposite area. All units can be secretly arranged apart from siege engines and ships, due to their size. When complete, press the start battle button to begin fighting.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_fleet_blockades	A blockade is a cordon of ships that prevents any trade going through a [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/018e_enc_manual_actions_campaign_construction.html#enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_infrastructure_ports"]]port[[/url]] whilst it is in place and any fleet moored there from escaping without fighting a battle. It can be broken by a naval attack on the blockading fleet. You can blockade a port by right-clicking on it as you would another fleet, with your own fleet selected. If there is an enemy fleet moored there, a cordon graphic will appear to indicate a blockade is under way. Otherwise, your fleet will row straight into the port and occupy it.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_siege	In order to gain control of a garrisoned and fortified settlement it is often necessary to lay siege. During a siege your troops surround it and can either attempt to starve the defenders into capitulation or launch a direct assault using siege equipment (both artillery and engines such as rams and towers). The besieged force may choose to sally out to meet you on the battlefield, but be aware that defeating them will not automatically result in the surrender of their settlement to you. Victory in a siege turns ownership of the province over to your faction. You then have a number of options available to you, detailed below, that have a scale of penalties attached to them. In addition, there will also be public order issues if the new owners of a region are of a different culture to that of the indigenous populace.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_resistance	Following the conquest of a region there will continue to be a degree of unrest in response to the change of ruler, especially one belonging to a different culture. This is called “resistance to occupation”. It declines gradually over time, but never totally disappears, so it is wisdom to leave adequate garrisons behind and manage taxation carefully.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces_growth	As your campaign progresses, growth enables surplus population to accumulate via the primary buildings in your settlements, enabling them to expand. Certain buildings will improve that rate of growth. However, the larger your settlements, the more food is consumed, so it is important to keep food producing buildings upgraded in tandem with the size of your settlement in order to avoid shortages.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_buildings	Buildings facilitate unit production, can increase income, and improve governmental control within a province. The number of slots available for building inside a settlement depends on its level - so the larger the city, the greater the number of buildings it can contain. Any chain of buildings can be constructed in these slots, although some buildings require the presence of certain resources or the research of certain technologies before they can be constructed.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_intro	When you selected a faction, you also chose a family or party to represent within its political system. Your faction leader is the head of that party. Many characters in your campaign contribute gravitas to your party's overall influence within your faction. The more ambitious a character is, the more useful they are likely to be to your faction. However, ambition is a double-edged sword: high ambition can lead to a bid for power through civil war, so it is important to keep an eye on such characters, they are not necessarily to be trusted. You can interact with any character involved in politics on the faction summary tab by adopting them, bribing them, marrying them to a daughter of your party, spreading reputation-damaging rumours about them, or having them assassinated.\\n\\nBy carefully managing characters of political importance and engaging in the various political actions available to you, it is possible to control the flow of power between the parties within your faction. Ultimately, balance is the key – your goal is to maintain inner stability, ensuring that no single party dominates the political arena. As a general rule, too much or too little influence held by any one party, whether ruling or not, will always equate to political imbalance, potentially causing insurrection. The choices you make during the course of your campaign affect the influence that each party possesses. This includes military and civil choices that might not seem directly political, such as which generals to appoint, which skills or ancillaries to upgrade them with, and even the order in which technologies are researched.\\n\\nThere is no single approach; political non-involvement (in other words, letting the situation unfold on its own while concentrating on civil and military matters) is not necessarily a bad thing, at least in the short term. However, in the long term, inaction will likely result in certain parties gaining or losing influence excessively without you knowing.  On the other hand, a player who is politically active will be able to maintain stability for as long as possible, increasing the amount of time before a challenge is made to their leadership. When such a challenge occurs, a rival political party will break off and appear as a new enemy faction, initiating a civil war. Players who choose not to pay attention to influence levels run the risk of this occurring when they least expect it, especially in the late game as their imperium reaches the upper tiers.\\n\\nThe civil war event is essentially the political endgame, see below for further details. 	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_mechanics	Diplomacy is the art of negotiation used to maintain relations between rival factions for as long as possible. Think of it as a useful tool for holding back the inevitable descent into hostilities. The diplomacy system enables you to construct deals with other factions to facilitate increased trade, military alliances and access through territory, peace treaties, and payments to secure an agreement, and, finally, when all else has failed, formal declarations of war. 	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_groups_controlled	After grouping units you have the opportunity to give that group over to an AI commander to control. The AI will react to nearby threats and maintain control until the battle is over or the player takes back control. With a group selected, use the attack or defend button to select the AI’s stance, then right-click to select an enemy target or an area to defend. They can be given a set of basic instructions:<p><p>A) Attack this enemy: Click on the enemy army you want the AI-controlled group to attack.<p>B) Defend this position: AI-controlled group will defend the position it is standing on.<p><p>The AI-controlled group will carry out its instructions until completed or you give it another, conflicting order.<p><p>NB: If the AI-controlled group destroys its target it will defend its current position until given further orders.<p><p>This functionality is accessed through the user interface at the bottom of the screen.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_alliance_defensive	A defensive alliance is an obligation to support another faction only if it suffers an official declaration of war. If a member is attacked its allies will be asked to join the war against the aggressor. Such an agreement can be upgraded to full military alliance, vassalage or client status.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_traditions	When a force is first mustered it is named, given a unique emblem and, from that point on, creates its own legacy through its actions in the field. This enables the development of traditions that have positive effects in the same way that skills benefit the characters that have them. Some traditions are unique to certain factions, affecting aspects of both battles and campaigns. An force's legacy and traditions forever remain with its emblem, living on long after its original troops have succumbed to their fates. When a new force is raised, you can choose to hand down the legacy of its forebears to your newest recruits.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_battle_siege_ladders	The simplest form of equipment, this is simply a long ladder that can be leaned against a settlement's walls so troops can try to climb onto the battlements and capture the towers and gates. Control of a gatehouse enables other troops to enter the besieged settlement unmolested by missile fire or boiling oil.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_defences_sharp_stones	Sharp stone beds are created from various types of stone, constructed as a form of non-lethal defence around settlements. Stones can either sunk into the ground or layed in irregular piles. Infantry find these difficult objects to traverse, whereas cavalry can only pass through by picking routes between the stones. This slowing effect produces an effective killing zone in and around the stones, ideal ground for missile units to trap their targets.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_garrison	By moving an army into a settlement, it becomes part of the garrison. Whilst inside, its units can replenish any losses at a faster rate and, if the settlement is attacked, will have improved morale. A garrisoned army suffers attrition when under siege if occupying a landlocked settlement or a port which is both under siege and blockade.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_crossings_bridges	If there is a bridge or ford crossing a river on the campaign map, and an army is standing close to it when they are attacked, the resulting battle will occur at the crossing, so the battlefield will feature the river and at least one bridge or ford. Remember, if you are the defender you may have to defend two crossings or you could use the second one to your advantage!	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_tech	Technology reflects the advancement of your faction through new ideas and techniques, allowing you to construct advanced buildings, new unit types or greatly improved equipment. A faction can develop technology along three paths of specialisation, each consisting of three interlocking modules. While each technology has its own inherent benefits, researching all technologies within a module has an overall effect that is greater than the sum of its parts. To begin, simply select the item you wish to research. There are no buildings required in order to do this, although there are some buildings that require certain technologies before they can be constructed. Mouse over a technology for a short description, details of effects, and the length of time needed to research it.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_undermine	Use of this action disrupts the target army, temporarily reducing its general’s authority, whilst reducing its ability to attack and defend in the field. Undermining authority has the added benefit of increasing vulnerability to further acts of subterfuge and reducing zone of control on the campaign map. The effectiveness of this action is dependent on your dignitary’s own authority, which can be increased by skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_threats	A dignitary can disrupt his target army by temporarily reducing its zeal with threats that a more powerful army is poised to destroy it. This dents the morale of its general and his bodyguard, whilst also diminishing the impact of their charge and both their melee and missile attack capabilities. On the campaign map, the army as a whole becomes more vulnerable to subterfuge. The chances of this action’s success depend on your dignitary’s zeal, which is affected by their skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_weather	Weather conditions should be considered when fighting a battle. Unless they can be used to your advantage, you may wish to delay fighting until they improve. The prevailing weather is displayed prior to deployment so you can make an informed choice about fighting in certain conditions before joining battle. Wet conditions will affect the usefulness of missile weapons in single player battles. This means that fire arrows will not work (and therefore cannot be used by either side). Fatigued units also recover more slowly in wet weather or snow. It is also much more difficult to set a building or ship alight in the rain, and by the same token anything on fire will be extinguished more quickly due to the downpour. Mists and fog may occur close to ground level or the surface of water, affecting the range and accuracy of missiles. Enemy units (not ships) will be concealed if they are 600 metres away or further.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_forests	Be careful when fighting in woods or forests, cavalry will be far less effective due to the restrictions on movement provided by tree cover.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_slaves	Slaves boost income at the cost of decreased public order. The greater the number of slaves present in a province, the higher the economic bonus given. They are a vital part of your labour force, enabling you to significantly boost your economy. However, dealing with them can be a double-edged sword, as enslaving enemy prisoners following battles, or capture of their settlements, can damage diplomatic relations with other factions of the same culture. Once captured, slaves are automatically distributed across your empire. If their numbers grow too large there may be dissent, which if left unchecked can eventually lead to a slave revolt.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_sieges_defence	When fighting a siege battle as the defender remember that the enemy will try to either sneak past your defences or rush them by force of arms. Use archers to kill approaching units and melee troops to kill those that get inside the walls! The enemy will try to wipe out all defenders, and if your men rout en masse from the settlement the battle is over.	true

With enough experience behind them they will increase in rank and skill points will be issued. At this stage they may invest a skill point towards acquiring a new skill or upgrading an existing one, allowing you to shape a character's career path. Skills require one point per upgrade and one point before they are awarded. Certain skills are associated with specific ranks, meaning that they cannot be acquired until the character has reached that skill’s rank requirement.

Light towers give speedy access to settlement walls and some protection to the troops inside it. Medium towers are clad in improved hide armour, which better protects their troops. Heavy towers carry superior iron plate armour, meaning their troops are well protected from enemy missile fire.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_coercion	The threat of violence can be very persuasive when attempting to coerce a target onto a course of action decided by you. Your dignitary’s zeal, along with the cunning of the target character or the strategic abilities of the target general, will determine the success of this action.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_corruption	By deploying a dignitary in a foreign province, security can be reduced, which also increases faction-wide corruption. This reduces satisfaction amongst the population and increases construction costs. Regions within the target province also become more vulnerable to further subterfuge. The effectiveness of this action is dependent on your dignitary’s authority, which can be increased by skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict	The conflict phase is the period after deployment when the actual fighting of the battle occurs. At this point it is possible to select your units or ships and give them orders, either by clicking on the appropriate unit card on the battle review panel or the unit or ship itself.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_diplomacy_options_war_coordination	War co-ordination is not a diplomatic option as such, but you can initiate it from the diplomacy panel. It makes your allies increase their efforts to destroy a designated target. You don't have to talk to a specific faction to designate a war co-ordination target; when you left-click on a settlement it is marked as the target and your allies will automatically send their forces against it.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_heading_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_flying_wedge_formation	Flying Wedge Formation	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_battle_stances_balanced	Balanced stance is generally the safest one to adopt. It ensures your units do not act too aggressively or defensively, reacting to events without undue bias in their behaviour, as no special bonuses are applied whilst they are in it. Your force will attempt to retreat if things get out of control and will chase down the enemy when they retreat. However, if you win the battle but the enemy force is still intact, they will retreat away from you; it may be necessary to attack a second time to destroy them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_scare_immune	A unit with this attribute cannot be scared by any of the scare attributes mentioned above.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_patrol	Fleets can be ordered to patrol the sea region they are stationed within. This stance enables them to passively detect and reduce piracy, also improving their ability to defend themselves if attacked during a turn.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_march	An army ordered to carry out a forced march gets a significant increase in the action points available to it, but is unable to initiate a battle. Furthermore, a marching army has a reduced line of sight, reflecting its focus on the job in hand; the drawback being that it is more susceptible to ambushes. If attacked, all units in a marching army suffer reduced morale to reflect the inherent surprise element. The resultant battle will always be an ambush.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_traits	In addition to the [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/042_enc_manual_skills.html"]]skills[[/url]] chosen for a character, he or she is also subject to the development of character traits that are a direct result of their behaviour (i.e. - bravery, cowardice) or the situations they find themselves in (i.e. - alcoholism, madness, promiscuity, boredom or all of these things). A negative trait is acquired gradually from a certain pattern of behaviour and can usually be expunged by a continued display of the opposite behaviour.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_persian	Missile units occupy the front line with light cavalry on their flanks, then a second line of melee infantry with heavy cavalry on their flanks. This was a popular formation favoured by the Achaemenid Persians.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_persuasion	Your champion will attempt to use strength of character to persuade the target character to act in your faction’s favour. Their level of authority, along with the zeal of the target character, influences the success of this action. Authority can be increased through skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_wealth_bonuses	Many buildings and technologies give bonuses to wealth. High-level buildings and late-game technologies give particularly significant boosts to a province’s wealth. Characters may also give wealth bonuses to any province they are in via their skills, traits, and ancillaries. Wealth bonuses provided by buildings increase the wealth production of all settlements within a province. Technology bonuses generally apply to all provinces within your empire. Wealth bonuses may apply either to wealth as a whole or be more specific and target only a single wealth type. These bonuses always apply to the whole province.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_mislead	This action disrupts the target army, temporarily reducing its general’s cunning by hindering his movements in battle and increasing the cooling down time before his own special abilities can be used again. Misleading command also reduces line of sight on the campaign map, making the army more vulnerable to further subterfuge. The success of this action depends on your dignitary’s zeal, which can be improved by skills, character traits, and the presence of household members or objects.	true

A simple yet effective device, sharpened stakes are set in 45 degree lines to impale charging men or horses. They can easily be navigated around when moving slowly, but even this can be used to the advantage of missile units.

Eventually, this proved successful and a small contingent of cavalry escaped to rally surrounding tribes and attack the Romans from the rear.\\n\\nIn game, Vercingetorix can use this ability once during a battle to reduce the fatigue of all friendly units within a 300 metre radius for a period of 60 seconds.	true

The size of the rebel army is always linked to the level of the settlement in the region from which it has spawned.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_morale	Morale is a measure of a unit's confidence and spirit during a battle. During a lengthy, protracted melee, the morale of the men is severely tested, and they will break and rout if it gets too low. This is indicated by the coloured bar at the top of each unit’s banner; when it is green morale is healthy, when it turns yellow a morale penalty is in place, when it turns red the unit is wavering and about to break and rout. The presence of the general alone can improve morale and highly-trained, elite units have much higher morale from the outset. Heroes also improve morale of those around them by their presence. Generals can also rally their men more effectively by use of their special [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/060s_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_rally.html"]]regroup position[[/url]], [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/060m_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire_land.html"]]inspire[[/url]] and [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/060n_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_inspire_sea.html"]]encourage[[/url]] abilities.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances	Armies and fleets can be assigned stances which improve their movement rate, line of sight, and various attack and defence attributes. Often, there is a trade-off between positive and negative effects. Select an army or fleet and click on the dedicated button at the bottom of the screen to choose one. A force's stance represents how its capabilities change under a number of situations: mustering (recruitment), forced marching, ambushes, raiding on land or at sea, garrisoning settlements, fortifying (setting camp), rowing at double time or patrolling a sea region. Each one has its advantages and drawbacks, costs a number of action points to execute and once entered, the force will stay in that stance until given a different order. It is not possible for an army to enter a stance when on a transport ship at sea, but that transport ship will have it's own stances that can be adopted.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions_bribe	Bribery has the simple effect of moving a character between an opposition party and your own, at a financial and a political cost. It is useful to decrease the opposition’s gravitas and increase your own in order to restore the political balance. If successful, the bribed character loses gravitas when he moves.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_spies_disorder	The spy uses their authority to cause civil disorder in the target province, increasing unrest from squalor and taxation whilst they remain within its settlement. This creates a decline in public order that will eventually lead to riots. The effectiveness of this agent action is dependent on the spy’s authority and certain skills, traits and household members or objects they may have acquired.	true

These work in a similar way to [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/043_enc_manual_traits.html"]]character traits[[/url]] but are present from the start of a campaign, rather than awarded as it progresses. Each trait has one or more effects that bestow a bonus or penalty on an aspect of the faction's activities, check the summary tab on the [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/016_enc_manual_hud_management.html"]]faction panel[[/url]] to see them. Faction traits are always permanent.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries	Dignitaries are experts in administration and masters of manipulation, recruited via the recruit agents button when a settlement is selected and civic technologies have been researched. They are vulnerable to spies and especially effective against champions.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_propaganda	Spreading propaganda works against the ruling culture of a region, enabling your dignitary to increase the rate of its population’s conversion to your own culture. The success of this action is dependent on your agent’s zeal, which can be increased through the acquisition of skills, character traits, and the household members or objects that he may have with them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_ui_battle_losing_generals	If a general is killed in battle whilst units or ships are [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/049_enc_manual_battle_conflict_controls.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_routing"]]routing[[/url]] they will become shattered, meaning that it will not be possible for them to be [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/060s_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_rally.html"]]rallied[[/url]] from then on.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_agents_cunning	Cunning is a character’s understanding of their role and their capacity to carry it out. It is the ability to use strategy, tactics, techniques and tricks to achieve their ends, and also resist cunning agent actions. For agents, high cunning increases their line of sight on the campaign map; for generals, it reduces the cooling down time before their armies' abilities can be used again and unlocks the "strategist" set of abilities.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_experience	As a unit fights and survives battles, it gains experience points that improve its ability to deal with future combat situations. Their first experience level is gained by taking 25% casualties, regardless of the number of kills made. Amongst other things, experience increases [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/052_enc_manual_battle_conflict_morale.html"]]morale[[/url]], so an experienced unit is then less likely to break and run from battle when under stress and [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/053_enc_manual_battle_conflict_fatigue.html"]]fatigue[[/url]]. Generals also gain experience points upon successful conclusion of a battle that can be used to choose useful military [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/042_enc_manual_skills.html"]]skills[[/url]] for them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_battle	The battle panel presents you with several options for resolving the upcoming battle - fighting on the battlefield or seascape, resolving the battle automatically via a comparison of each force's statistics and withdrawing from the fight. If you withdraw when attacked there is a good chance that the attacking force will attack you again. If you have attacked a provincial capital there will also be options to continue the siege, to break it off, and to construct siege engines on-site for assaulting enemy settlements. Note that siege engines take a number of turns to complete before use. If you have more than twenty units they will automatically be fielded as a single force. If you wish to field twenty units and have any others appear as reinforcements you must uncheck the box on the battle panel.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_wealth	An empire might be created by armies, but a strong economy is required in order to achieve stability. Income is made through the taxation of a province’s wealth and is then used to pay for the upkeep of your existing forces, to recruit new troops, and to construct new buildings. Each settlement has a certain amount of wealth produced by the buildings constructed there. The total wealth provided across all settlements within a province is referred to as provincial wealth. Wealth and all relevant bonuses to it are always province-wide. Wealth is turned into income through taxation, so if there is a normal tax rate and there are no other modifying factors present, all provincial wealth is income. This situation, however, rarely occurs.	true

Outnumbering the Romans, the Nervii force smashed into the Roman flank and successfully pushed through their battle line, almost cutting it in two.\\n\\nIn battle, Boduognatus can target a friendly unit once during a battle, increasing their attack capabilities and making their morale unbreakable for 60 seconds.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_training	The presence of a champion within a friendly army can boost their zeal and increase the experience for all units within it whilst the agent remains in their ranks. Zeal influences the morale of an army’s general and his bodyguard. It also improves their charge, melee attack, and missile attack skills. On the campaign map, zeal increases resistance to authoritarian agent actions, improves an army’s action points, and increases the profits from raiding. The effectiveness of this action is dependent on your champion’s zeal and certain skills, traits and household members or objects they may have acquired.	true

In addition to zeal, the target character’s own cunning or the strategic abilities of the target general also affect this action’s chances of success. Zeal can be increased via the acquisition of skills, character traits, and any household members or objects your agent may have with them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_fatigue	A unit that is resistant to [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/053_enc_manual_battle_conflict_fatigue.html"]]fatigue[[/url]] will take longer to tire in battle.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_admin	A dignitary can improve security and reduce administration costs when sent to a friendly province. Strong civil administration influences a population’s satisfaction with its ruling faction, can reduce construction costs and increase vigilance towards subterfuge. The success of civil administration is dependent on your dignitary’s authority, which varies depending on the skills and character traits they have acquired, in addition to the presence of any household members or objects.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_generals	The general has a huge influence on his army’s fortunes in battle, not least because the abilities at his disposal can turn the tide in their favour. You can unlock generals’ abilities and develop them in-line with skills and experience, sometimes upgrading them to become stronger or affect more units. There are three attributes that unlock different categories of general’s ability: “Warrior”, which is unlocked by high zeal; “Commander”, which become available when authority is high; “Strategist”, which is dependent on high cunning. As a general or admiral improves each of his three attributes, he will progressively unlock further abilities.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_generals	Generals and admirals are used to command armies and fleets in battle. Their attributes influence the effectiveness with which their army or fleet fights, including their morale, so if one is killed in battle the shock of his death affects his troops and can cause them to waver or even rout. Generals and admirals can acquire skills, character traits, and household members or objects that affect their performance as they gain experience in battle and increase in rank, as well as cursus honorum offices to convey additional bonuses. Recruit a general or admiral by selecting a settlement and then clicking on the raise army or raise fleet button. Available candidates are displayed there. Select one and then click on the raise army or raise fleet button to hire him and begin mustering a force.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_legacies	When a force is first mustered it is named, given a unique emblem and, from that point on, creates its own legacy through its actions in the field. This enables the development of traditions that have positive effects in the same way that skills benefit the characters that have them. Some traditions are unique to certain factions, affecting aspects of both battles and campaigns. A force's legacy and traditions forever remain with its emblem, living on long after its original troops have succumbed to their fates. When a new force is raised, you can choose to hand down the legacy of its forebears to your newest recruits.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_recruitment	Units are the constituent parts of your army and are divided into classes that broadly define their role on the battlefield. They are recruited directly to your general, either in the field or when garrisoning a settlement. This is known as mustering. The only troops displayed are those troop types available in the region in which he is currently standing, i.e. it is not possible to draw in recruits from other regions. Select your general and then the recruit units button. Left click on a unit card to add it to the recruitment queue. When ready, units will automatically appear in the army of the mustering general.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_champions_slaves	Whilst inside a settlement, your champion’s presence increases unrest amongst the slaves living there.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_subjects	Subjects are characters that take part in the your faction’s life and politics. Appearing throughout the game in missions, incidents and dilemmas, as well as the faction summary tab, they are not just serving generals and admirals (commanders), but also statesmen at the faction capital. In political terms, statesmen are the same as commanders and have influence-contributing gravitas, but unlike commanders they don’t have a physical presence on the campaign map, instead holding positions in political office until a new army or fleet is raised and requires leadership. Additionally, a commander does not have to die to be replaced; you can replace him by selecting his army on the campaign map and navigating to the replace option on the general’s details panel. If you choose to put an existing statesman in command of an existing military force, a swap will occur and the previous commander will be removed from the field, becoming a statesman instead.\\n\\nConverting a statesman into an admiral or general has no financial cost. However, the pool of command candidates will frequently be populated by other characters that do cost money to recruit. This cost is not only for the creation of the new commander, but essentially also represents the cost of bringing characters out of civilian life and into politics. Rather importantly, they already have predefined allegiances towards certain parties and, once recruited, will appear on the faction summary tab and contribute gravitas to their party’s influence.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that both commanders and statesmen are always involved in party politics until their deaths, regardless of their presence on the battlefield. The notable difference between statesmen and commanders is that the latter are able to actively increase their own gravitas by winning battles. This could be a reason to replace one commander with another – in order to help increase the gravitas of a politically-inferior statesman by giving him the opportunity to attain military victory.\\n\\nMany command choices have potential political ramifications, but often circumstances do not make the choice so straightforward. For example, a large and ever-expanding empire (and therefore high imperium) is fighting a war far away from its faction capital in which a top general has just been killed. If the next-best candidate in the pool is an existing statesman representing an opposition party with ambition and high gravitas, appointing him as a replacement may increase his party’s influence - upsetting the balance and leading to civil war when most forces are away on foreign soil. It is therefore important to remember, when making a military decision, that there could be political ramifications that may not be immediately obvious.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_infrastructure_farms	Farms are positioned in the fields in rural areas away from settlements. They provide an income and are an essential source of food, so not upgrading them will eventually lead to [[url="encyclopedia/how_to_play/019b_enc_manual_food_shortages.html"]]food[[/url]] shortages.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_wealth_types	There are different types of wealth:\\n\\n* Agriculture (often produced by farms)\\n\\n* Culture (often produced by temples and city centre buildings)\\n\\n* Industry (often produced by industrial buildings and some ports)\\n\\n* Livestock (often produced by cattle or sheep buildings)\\n\\n* Local Commerce (often produced by city centre buildings and commercial ports)\\n\\n* Maritime Commerce (exclusively produced by commercial ports)\\n\\n* Subsistence (exclusively produced by main settlement buildings)\\n\\nAny type of wealth can be produced by any building as it is not the building chain that determines the type produced, but the building itself. For example, the agricultural chain can produce both agriculture and livestock wealth. The type of wealth produced by a building can be seen by mousing over its icon and checking the information panel in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. An overview of the total wealth produced by a settlement can be seen by mousing over the wealth display on the province details panel.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battlefield_victory	The scale of any victory in battle is measured by the number of casualties suffered by each side. However, in siege, port assault and encampment battles the attacker can capture key positions known as victory points. When two thirds of the available victory points have been captured, or the only one in the case of minor settlements or encampment battles, the defenders’ victory tickets will start to diminish by way of a countdown. The defender must reclaim their victory points to stop this happening or lose the battle when the number of tickets reaches zero. 	true

The details of such an agreement are not visible to you, you simply set it up and the rest of the negotiation is implied by the other party's acceptance. Trade agreements are hugely profitable for the factions involved. Once an agreement is in place, a trade route is established between the two, with any ports or settlements along it receiving a share of the income. The trade of natural resources influences their global prices by the law of supply and demand. Trade agreements continue until one party breaks the agreement, suffering a penalty to their diplomatic relations. Long-standing trade partners develop a healthy respect for each other, reflected by increased income from trade routes over the life of the agreement.	true

Although this strategy worked for some time, eventually Caesar forced a pitched battle, during which Ariovistus’ forces counter-charged with such speed and force that the Romans did not have time to throw their pilae before being forced into melee with the Germans.\\n\\nIn game, Ariovistus can target a friendly unit once during a battle, increasing their speed and the force of their charge for 45 seconds. In turn, the targeted unit has a chance of spreading these effects to other friendly units within a 30 metre radius of their position.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes	Attributes are the innate, "passive" abilities that units and ships can use to govern their capabilities in battle. As such, they do not generally have to be activated, although an attribute may bestow an ability activated by a button on the battle interface. For example, some units are inherently fearsome, so their very presence in battle can “Frighten” an enemy, reducing their morale. Similarly, some units “Can Hide”, enabling them to remain out of sight of enemy units within certain distances.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_imperium	Your faction’s imperium is a measure of your progress during a campaign as viewed by rivals within your faction. It can be increased by conquests. If your influence becomes too great you will be considered a threat by the other parties, at which point you will be declared an enemy of the state and a civil war will begin. As your imperium becomes great, politics has greater importance, because this is when it is most likely that civil war will occur. As your empire grows, it becomes more difficult to maintain stability within your faction. When full imperium has been achieved it is important to keep a very close eye on the situation, because fluctuations in influence may be more extreme. Also, keep in mind that you may not always be able to recruit a general from the ‘right’ party. Too much power results in a civil war against separatists; too little and those scheming to take advantage of your political weakness may attempt to oust you, snatching the leadership for themselves. It is therefore important to use the early game to learn how politics can help you, and, once your empire has grown, actively try to keep everything in balance.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_actions_promotion	Promotion can only be secured for members of your ruling party and its effects are not entirely political. A character given higher political office will see an immediate boost to his gravitas. However, such promotions also bestow special Cursus Honorum traits, which also have their own effects. This action can be carried out multiple times (up to a maximum level) as long as the target character is the right age and rank required for each successive promotion.  At the first level, the cost is the support of a few patricians. With each promotion thereafter, there is an ascending financial cost in addition to the loss of support.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_boarding	Any naval ramming action can result in boarding.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_visibility	In Total War: ROME II, visibility of enemy units depends entirely on what your own units can see at any given time, so, if the enemy are hidden by a building or the terrain itself, they may not be visible to your forces. By the same token, enemy units may disappear during a battle if they pass out of view of your troops. An eye icon appears above your unit when it is hidden or when it is out of the enemy’s line of sight. It will disappear when your unit has been spotted by the enemy. It’s also important to note that visibility is entirely separate to the hiding attribute. Although deployment enables the secret deployment of most units, ships and siege equipment cannot be hidden from the enemy due to their size.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_gravitas	Gravitas is a character’s popularity and standing in the Roman world and is the key factor in determining their party's influence. All the characters in a party contribute, but the effect is relative to the total gravitas of its rival parties. So, if an opposition party has several high-Gravitas members and you don't, the likelihood is that their influence will increase each turn, while yours will decrease.\\n\\nAlso remember that a character’s ambition can increase the effect their gravitas has on their party’s influence, so it is prudent to keep an eye on your generals, as victory increases personal ambition. The more ambitious a character is in relation to others, the more effect his gravitas will have on his party’s share of power.\\n\\nTo manipulate a party’s influence, increase or reduce the amount of gravitas their characters possess. For example, one could attempt to discredit a party by spreading rumours about some or all of its members, reducing their overall gravitas. However, assassination of a prominent opposition member might have an even greater effect, since all of a character’s contributing gravitas can be removed completely in one swift action. Conversely, adoption steals a character from another party, taking gravitas away from them and adding it to your own. More details will be given about political actions later on.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_culture	Every faction belongs to a culture that dictates its style of buildings and the types of unit available to it. There are five culture types: Roman, Hellenic, Punic, Barbarian, and Eastern. Dignitary agents can be sent ahead of an army to spread your culture amongst a population before you conquer them, heading off any public order problems that may arise if you conquer a region belonging to a different culture. 	true

Left-click on a building to add it to the construction queue, and again to remove it. The cost of construction is displayed at the bottom and the time required is shown in the top left of the picture. Buildings facilitate unit production, can increase income, and improve governmental control within a province. The building chains constructible at each settlement often depend on the availability of particular resources, or the research of certain technologies, before they can be constructed. Right-click on a building's picture to view its description and statistics.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_campaign_battle_types_land_limes_encampment	When an army in fortified stance is attacked it will result in a limes (frontier) or encampment battle, where the defenders will deploy in or around a wooden fort. As before, allied or reinforcing forces may be drawn into the battle. Allied or reinforcing forces may be drawn into the fight.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_attack_capture_occupy	Your force occupies the settlement, receiving a penalty to public order. Anyone captured is automatically released.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_fragments_merge	Forces that are not large enough to be effective could be destroyed if attacked by a superior force, so it is prudent to merge any fragments together. It is possible to merge two friendly armies or fleets together when neither is at full strength (a full strength force is twenty units in size). Merge by left-clicking on your first one and then right-clicking on the second. The first force will then move over to the second and the two will merge together. However, it is not possible to have more than one general within an army, so you must disband the lesser of the two after transferring his units. If there are twenty units or more in either force the merge panel will appear, so you can choose which units or ships to merge into a single force and which to leave behind.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_campaign_battle_types_naval_coastal	A coastal battle occurs when land and/or sea forces are engaged, no settlement is present, and a land army is attacked by another near the coast. Allied or reinforcing forces will appear on the battlefield.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_campaign_battle_types_land_ambush	An ambush takes place when an army attacks when in ambush stance or if they attack an enemy who is in forced march stance, otherwise a standard land battle occurs. The attacker’s allies or reinforcements may be drawn into the fight, but not the defender’s.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_heavy_missile_single	This formation allows you to shatter the enemy's centre with missile fire whilst your heavy melee ships close in on their flanks. The heaviest ships are positioned closest to the centre.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_characters_agents_dignitaries_military_admin	A dignitary embedded in a friendly army can improve its general’s authority attribute and reduce upkeep costs. Authority represents the influence of the general over his army and their attack and defence capabilities, making it more resistant to subterfuge on the campaign map and potentially increasing its zone of control. The effectiveness of this action depends on your dignitary’s own authority, which can be increased with skills, character traits, and household members or objects.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_hide	Ambush stance immobilises an army but increases its line of sight and makes it invisible to nearby enemy forces. If undetected, a hidden army can attack any enemy that wanders into its zone of control. The success of such an ambush depends on the quality of the commanders involved and the nature of the surrounding terrain.	true

It can be toggled on and off by clicking on the wedge formation button that appears at the bottom of the screen when a cavalry unit is selected.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_triplex_acies	The classic triplex acies formation places melee infantry in three lines, with the lightest at the front and spearmen in the last line. Missile infantry are deployed at the front to skirmish, with cavalry at the rear and on the flanks.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_land_simplex_acies	A basic army formation with loose formation spearmen in the front row, equally spaced melee infantry behind, with cavalry at the back and missile infantry deployed at the very front.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_politics_civil_war	Politics in Total War: ROME II is about maintaining the balance of influence. Left unchecked, it is possible for stability to deteriorate to a point where the gulf in political power between the parties causes a civil war. If your party becomes too powerful in a republic, mistrust and paranoia ultimately lead to a challenge for control of your faction. At this point, civil war ensues; the remaining parties unite and lead rebel forces to capture the capital and overthrow your regime. Similarly, should you be deemed too weak, you may be exiled as an enemy of the state, with little choice but to lead your armies against the usurpers. In a tribal society or a monarchy, your tribe or family branch could be challenged should they be deemed weak, again leading to civil war. At this point, a new enemy faction emerges to attempt a coup d’état either at your faction capital or at the farthest point from it. The newly emerged faction is a direct result of the opposition to your party's rule within your own; it is not possible to engage in diplomacy with them, and they will always try to capture or hold your faction capital if the coup did not originate there. Civil war can only continue for a limited time, at which point they are automatically resolved by treaty, the terms of which are decided by the balance of power at the point of resolution.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_fleet_moves_blocked	Positioning a fleet between two straits enables it to block other fleets from using that route and enemy armies or agents from crossing between the headlands.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_character_presence	On several occasions Caesar’s presence close to the action inspired his troops to carry on the fight when the outcome of a battle was uncertain. Knowing this, he deliberately put himself in danger at critical moments, dismounting his horse and joining the melee. The news rippled through the frontlines, spurring his men on to victory.\\n\\nIn game, Caesar can use this ability once during a battle to increase his area of influence to 30 metres. As a result, friendly units within it have the cooling down time needed between use of their own abilities reduced to 60 seconds.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_square_formation	This is a close, square formation which increases a unit's defensive capabilities. It is ideally used when you are outnumbered or want to pin down part of an enemy line.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_hud_management_family	The important characters column, on the left-hand side of the panel, depicts characters from the various parties within your ruling faction, enabling you to assign cursus honorum offices and engage in politics with them.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_campaign_battle_stances_protective	Adopting protective stance ensures your units take a defensive position, advancing slowly in formation. They will attempt to retreat if things get out of control and won’t try to chase down retreating units to avoid getting enemy tricks and ruses. When using it, the following bonuses and penalties are applied: your spear infantry receives a bonus when fighting against cavalry, whilst mounted enemies get an attack bonus; missile units on both sides have their effectiveness increased; your units get a global defence bonus, whilst the enemy gets an attack bonus; forces will attempt to retreat if they suffer considerable losses.\\n\\nAdditionally, in sieges, if attacking, the more siege artillery you have (onagers, ballistas, etc.), the more effective your spear and melee infantry will become; if defending, the more spear and melee infantry you have, the smaller the enemy’s bonus for their siege engines (towers, ladders, etc.)	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_cantabrian_circle	A unit with this ability can fire outwardly whilst riding in a circle, which enables them to concentrate their fire on a target whilst making them more difficult to hit with missiles.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_raid	When ordered into a raiding stance, your army or fleet draws income from nearby trade routes and settlements. This decreases its upkeep costs, but reduces its defensive capabilities and movement range on the campaign map. The amount of booty gained through raiding is relative to the size of your force and is deducted from the income of the route or settlement in question. Raiding in foreign territory harms diplomatic relations, but isn’t an overt act of war. In dire situations, a force may raid within its own territory, causing a degree of unrest as a result.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_army_battle_siege_ram	Battering rams are a simple and effective way to break down settlement gates. Coming in three classes - light, medium, and heavy, each one carrying heavier armour than the class below it. Battering rams also affect the morale of the defenders - each blow acting as a deafening countdown until the assault begins, bringing almost-certain death with it.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_construction_slums	An empty construction slot or ruined building (one that is 100% damaged) can be turned into a slum. Slums consume food and generate squalor, but also increase population growth, enable the recruitment of mob units, and reduce the cost of recruiting light units.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces_squalor	As your population increases, the conditions inside your settlements worsen as more and more people are crammed into the limited space. It is therefore sensible to upgrade buildings in the capital chain so living space expands to cope with a larger populace. Ignoring squalor eventually leads to public order problems. Some buildings increase squalor also, so always make sure there is enough space, food and income to soften the blow before selecting them for construction.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_stances_camp	By setting camp, your army fortifies itself against attack and defends the surrounding area. Although immobile, a fortified army has greater defensive capabilities, line of sight and reinforcement range.

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_cavalry_testudo_formation	Cavalry testudo is a defensive formation ideally used when the enemy is fielding missile units and your cavalry need to be kept close to the frontline without being picked off. Units performing cavalry testudo raise their shields and angle themselves towards their aggressor, which improves their resistance to missile attack whilst still enabling them to break into a charge if desired.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_units	Units are the constituent parts of your army and are divided into classes that broadly define their role on the battlefield. There are also light and heavy versions within many classes, which is a reflection of the relative mass, speed and number of hits their individual troops can take before being killed. Units are recruited from buildings: the higher the level of building, the more advanced the unit type available. In order to recruit you must have a general, either in the field or inside a settlement.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_ui_frontend_grand_clan_difficulty	On the faction selection screen it is also possible to choose to play on a "legendary" level of difficulty. When selected, legendary difficulty applies to both campaign map and battlefield play, campaign play enabling the unique achievement "Imperator". On the campaign map it carries the following restrictions: manual saving will be disabled and auto-saving will occur at the end of each turn and before and after each battle. It will not be possible to reload any save but the last one that occurred. On the battlefield legendary difficulty will carry the following restrictions: the tactical overview map will be minimised - it will not be possible to re-open it and it will not be possible to issue orders or move the camera when the battle is paused. It will only be possible to open the game menu and exit the battle, all enemy unit tooltips will be restricted to the type of unit and number of troops, camera movement will be limited to within 200 metres of any of your units, and any enemy units more than 600 metres away will function as if hiding.   	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_battle_sieges_levels	The wall-mounted defences of a settlement depend purely on the upgrade level of its main building. The size of the walls is always the same, but arrow and scorpio towers are added as the main building is upgraded, eventually leading to bastions, which are artillery platforms you can use to position a single scorpion, ballista, or onager. Due to this, a single piece of artillery placed upon a bastion has more effective ammunition than it would normally carry as part of a battery. As such, the following defences are available to besieged occupants:	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_index_skills	When a general fights battles or an agent carries out their mission they gain experience. With enough experience behind them they will increase in rank and skill points will be issued. At this stage they may invest a skill point towards acquiring a new skill or upgrading an existing one, allowing you to shape a character's career path. Skills require one point per upgrade and one point before they are awarded. Certain skills are associated with specific ranks, meaning that they cannot be acquired until the character has reached that skill’s rank requirement. 	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_formations_naval_diekplous	This formation is a formation of multiple columns, designed to break into an enemy line and pin their fleet down for one-on-one engagements. It is best used against a fleet formed of a single line.	true
encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_loose	As a reflection of their flexible and ultimately superior tactical training, loose formation can be used to increase the target area of Roman melee units only, making them more difficult for the enemy to target (as they not standing closely packed together). Loose formation is not suitable for charges of any kind, as a closely-packed mass of men is crucial to the impact required to smash through a line. It can be toggled on and off by clicking on the loose formation button that appears at the bottom of the screen when the relevant unit is selected.	true

encyclopedia_blocks_content_enc_text_manual_actions_campaign_provinces	A province consists of up to four regions, each one containing a settlement, the hub of activity within it and in which you can construct buildings to improve its strategic and economic potential, enabling growth. One of these is always the provincial capital, a major, walled settlement, whilst the remainder are minor settlements without defensive walls. Building construction improves the strategic and economic potential of settlements, enabling them to grow. Depending on settlement size and available resources, different chains of buildings are available for development. Over time, provincial growth enables you to develop settlements either by upgrading existing buildings or by constructing additional ones. Depending on settlement size and regional resources, different chains of buildings will become available for development. Coastal settlements can also contain port buildings that enable the construction of fleets.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_punic_hannibal	“God has given to man no sharper spur to victory than contempt of death.” – Hannibal Barca\\n\\nHannibal is widely regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in history. He was a son of Hamilcar Barca, a Carthaginian leader who had fought in the First Punic War, remaining undefeated when Carthage sued for peace. Afterwards, Hamilcar conquered Iberia to regain Carthage’s lost fortunes, exploiting the silver deposits found there to pay its war reparations to Rome and make his nation powerful again. He famously made his young son swear that he would “never be a friend to the Romans”. Following eight successful years in the region, Hamilcar was killed during battle against the Iberian tribes in 228BC.\\n\\nDespite his young age – 26 years - Hannibal assumed power in Iberia following the assassination of his brother-in-law, Hasdrubal “the Fair” – so named for his preference for diplomacy over conflict. From here, he sacked the Roman protectorate of Saguntum and began the Second Punic War. His army’s journey over the Alps has become legend; a feat of daring and endurance that took Rome entirely by surprise.\\n\\nHannibal’s efforts during the war - scoring devastating victories at Trebia, Lake Trasimene and Cannae - ravaged the Roman state and nearly brought the Republic to its knees. It is due to Hannibal, without a doubt, that Carthage’s war effort was successful for so many years. Ultimately, however, a series of setbacks, betrayals and a lack of support at home for the lengthy war stalled the conquest of Italy, eventually leading to his defeat at the climactic Battle of Zama in 202BC.\\n\\nAfter the war, Hannibal became a successful governor of Carthage. However, political opponents soon forced him into exile, where he became military advisor to the Seleucid Empire and several other eastern Hellenistic states. Unfortunately, pressure from the Romans as they expanded into the east eventually led to Hannibal’s betrayal, and he poisoned himself to evade capture around 182BC.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_carthage	Commencing 149-148BC, the Siege of Carthage was the defining action of the Third Punic War between Rome and Carthage. With the city refusing to surrender, the Carthaginians held out for over two years. The Roman forces, led by Manius Manilius, initially suffered losses at the hands of Hasdrubal and, following Manius’ failure, Scipio Aemilianus was appointed consul and charged with taking Carthage. Under Roman law, he was technically too young for the job. His first action was to defeat Diogenes’ army holding Nepheris by blockading the harbour of Carthage, cutting off their supplies, and forcing them into the field. With Nepheris crushed, Scipio intensified the main siege. In the final assault, Tiberius Gracchus, Scipio’s military tribune and brother-in-law, was the first over the wall. After hours of bitter fighting in the streets, houses and temples, the Carthaginians surrendered. The surviving population was enslaved, and Carthage levelled. Hasdrubal himself begged for mercy. His wife, unable to face such shame, killed herself and their sons. For his service, Scipio was greatly rewarded, and during his triumph was able to add “Africanus” to his name. Unusually, Hasdrubal was displayed rather than killed, possibly because of the greater humiliation involved. Despite his bravery at Carthage, Tiberius’ military fortunes waned during the Numantine War, but his later actions as a plebeian tribune earned him the favour of the common people.	true

A shrewd war-leader, Boduognatus used the advantage of his local knowledge of the terrain to spring an ambush on the Romans at the Battle of Sabis. The attack of the Nervii and their allied client tribes, the Atrebates and Viromandui, took Caesar’s forces by surprise and almost overwhelmed them. However, the 10th legion, under the command of Titus Labienus, turned the tide of battle. Boduognatus, like his warriors, refused to give ground, even in defeat, and was killed, while the strength of the Nervii was decimated.

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_ariovistus	Ariovistus was the leader of the Germanic Suebi, or “our people”. Invited by the Arverni and Sequani to aid them in their struggle against the pro-Roman Aedui, Ariovistus led his people across the Rhine, defeating the Aedui at the Battle of Magetobriga in 63 BC. In the aftermath, in exchange for their aid, the Suebi began to settle in Sequani territory. This put considerable pressure on the surrounding tribes, sparking the mass migration of the Helvetii. Rome was equally uncomfortable with the Ariovistus taking root in Gaul, but the Senate recognised him as a ‘King and Friend of the Roman People’, reputedly at Caesar’s behest, in a move to appease him. By 58BC, with the situation worsening, the Aedui and other Gallic tribes petitioned Caesar for aid. Given an ultimatum by Caesar to cease Suebian settlement and warring in Gaul, Ariovistus challenged Caesar to stop him. Conflict was inevitable as their envoys failed to reach agreement. In the battle that followed however, Ariovistus’ tribal force was broken and he and his surviving kin fled back across the Rhine, after which he was never heard from again.	true

As such, he commanded engagements throughout the Gallic Wars of 58-50BC, and took full command of the legions and magisterial duties during Caesar’s absences. A brilliant strategist and commander, it was Labienus who turned the tide of battle against the Nervii. Prior to the Battle of Agendicum in 52BC, he tricked the rebelling Gallic tribes into splitting their forces, before out manoeuvring and defeating Camelugenus’ army in a pincer movement. In the civil war that followed the Gallic campaigns, Labienus allied with Pompey against Caesar. After Pompey’s death, he remained loyal to his sons, fighting against Caesar in the battles of Ruspina, Thaspus, and Munda, where he was killed during the final rout.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_punic	The Second Punic War is, arguably, the most sweeping, destructive war of ancient times. It marked the end of a contest for power in the Mediterranean - the establishment of Roman hegemony over the entire Italian peninsula and deep into Iberia.\\n\\nIt was a hard fought victory for Rome, however; Hannibal Barca’s campaign in Italy, following his daring crossing of the Alps, nearly brought Rome to ruin. Catastrophic defeats at Trebia, Lake Trasimene and Cannae shattered any faith Rome’s allies had in them, and almost imploded the Republic.\\n\\nThe brilliance of Hannibal as a strategist and tactician cannot be denied; he came closer than anyone else ever had or would to toppling Roman power, but his failure was underestimating Rome’s ability to endure. After weathering the worst of Hannibal’s assault, Rome struck back under the brilliance of Scipio and finally, on the field at Zama, Carthage’s dream came crashing to an end.\\n\\nMany accounts of the Second Punic War come from Polybius and Livy, neither of whom were alive when the events they describe took place and wrote only from Rome’s perspective. Polybius in particular, is famed for being openly critical of Carthage (he was allegedly present for the final destruction of the ancient capital), and in particular the Barcids, so his accounts are heavily biased towards Rome and can almost be considered propaganda.\\n\\nAlthough the power plays of Julius Caesar, and the formation of the Roman Empire under Octavian, were still many years away, Rome’s victory over Carthage and its confederates laid the foundations for Rome the superpower.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_caesar	Born in July 100 BC, Julius Caesar was a member of the Julii patrician clan, who claimed descent from the goddess Venus. A brilliant strategist, inspiring commander, and shrewd politician, Caesar manoeuvred himself into a position of power within the Roman Republic. With Pompey and Crassus he formed the First Triumvirate, an expedient political alliance that pitted them against their conservative opponents in the Senate. Holding a ten-year proconsulship through the machinations of this alliance, he used the time wisely to conquer Gaul and defeat the Germanic tribes of the Rhineland. Recording the success of these campaigns in his ‘Commentaries on the Gallic War’, including his invasion of Britannia and the bridging of the Rhine. Following his conquest, when ordered by the Senate to relinquish his command and return to Rome, Caesar refused. His crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC and the civil war that followed led to the end of the Republic. As dictator he made many positive reforms, but his enemies continued to circle. On the Ides of March 44 BC he was assassinated in the Senate by a group of senators led by Marcus Brutus.

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_raphia	The Battle of Raphia in 217BC was fought in the Fourth Syrian War between Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire. Control of Syria and its extremely useful Mediterranean coast changed hands many times in the space of a century. As Successors to, and masters of portions of, Alexander’s empire, the Ptolemaic and Seleucid dynasties could not cede control of Syria to the other party: it would have been a sign of weakness. This brought them into conflict time and time again, and, in June 217BC, the two mightiest Greek-style armies ever seen led by King Ptolemy IV Philopator, and King Antiochus III the Great, clashed at Raphia. After days of skirmishing, the battle proper began with a charge of war elephants from both sides. Antiochus drove off the Ptolemaic cavalry and pursued them, thinking the battle was won. By the time he returned to the field his own centre had broken and was in disarray. His troops fled, and the battle was lost. Ptolemy IV’s victory was not without problems. He did retain control of much of Syria but the cost weakened his position at home. His Egyptian veterans rebelled and established a separate kingdom in the southern part of Upper Egypt. The secessionists, and the rebel 35th ruling dynasty, were finally crushed in 185BC. In keeping with Egyptian tradition, the victorious Greek-dominated government destroyed any mention of the rebels that they could find.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_marc	Born in January 83BC, into the Antonia clan, Marc Antony’s mother was the cousin of Julius Caesar. Following his command of a Gallic cavalry regiment in Syria, he was appointed to Caesar’s staff in 54BC and fought in the Gallic Wars. Marc Antony was a staunch supporter of Caesar, both as an accomplished military commander and later in political office. In 50BC, Caesar arranged for him to become augur, quaestor, and a plebeian tribune in an attempt to secure his own political position. Marc Antony’s subsequent violent expulsion from the Senate was one of the justifications Caesar used for crossing the Rubicon. After Caesar’s assassination, Marc Antony allied with Octavian, Caesar’s adopted son, and Lepidus. But then this Second Triumvirate also descended into civil war, as Antony and Cleopatra struggled with Octavian for control of the Republic. Marc Antony’s defeat at the naval Battle of Actium in 31BC, and the desertion of his legions, led both he and Cleopatra to take their own lives.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_vercingetorix	Vercingetorix, which roughly translates as “great warrior king”, was a chieftain of the Gallic Arverni. Against a backdrop of increasing anti-Roman sentiment in Gaul, he led his tribe and others in rebellion against Caesar’s legions in 52BC. Although initially opposed by the Arverni noble council, who expelled him and his dependents from the capital of Gergovia, he retook the city by force and was proclaimed king. In a later attempt to cut off the Roman legions from their supplies, he conducted a scorched earth policy. Eventually out-manoeuvred by the Romans, the Gallic tribes were forced to retreat to natural strongpoints. It was Vercingetorix’s retreat to the fortified city of Alesia that proved the undoing of his grand rebellion. Trapped by Caesar, who circumvallated the entire city, Vercingetorix and his force were starved into submission. After a Gallic relief force failed to beak in, Vercingetorix surrendered. Taken in chains to Rome, he was held prisoner for five years, before being displayed and then executed at Caesar’s processional triumph in 46BC.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_curio	Gaius Scribonius Curio was the son of the Roman statesman and orator of the same name. He was a contemporary of Pompey, Caesar and Cicero, and a respected orator in his own right. He is particularly noteworthy for constructing Rome’s first amphitheatre. Elected as a tribune in 50BC, Curio became a supporter of Caesar just as Pompei demanded Caesar give up his command. Cicero was one of the last senators to try and broker peace between the two statesmen. Despite his efforts, the two did not come to terms, and Curio was forced to flee Rome and join Caesar. In return for his support, Caesar paid off Curio’s debts. This led to the belief (as stated by Tacitus) that Caesar bribed him for his oratory skill. In the Civil War, Curio was made praetor, emerging victorious against the armies of Pompei. Eventually, he was sent to Africa to quell pro-Pompey sentiment, where he was killed during the 2nd Battle of Bagradas River.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_cicero	Quintus Tullius Cicero was the younger brother of the famed statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero. He served under Caesar as a trusted legate in his Gallic campaigns, notably accompanying the Proconsul on his second expedition to Britannia. Gaining much praise and support from Caesar for his inspirational military leadership, on more than one occasion, Cicero’s command turned almost certain Roman defeats into victory. The loyalty engendered between Caesar and Cicero may go some way to explaining the pardon he received after supporting Pompei during Caesar’s civil war. An honest governor who did not take bribes, Cicero was, however, also known for his emotional impulsiveness and occasional, but worrying cruelty. The Romans of the first century BC - firm believers in their own brand of stoicism - looked down on these harsh outbursts, particularly his treatment towards captives and any who dared to disobey, as he favoured old-fashioned, brutal punishments. Ultimately, Cicero’s loyalty and skill preserved him following Caesar's victory, but his good fortune left him during the Second Triumvirate, when he found himself proscribed as an enemy of the state and was killed in 43BC.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_wonders_olympus	Mount Olympus is the tallest mountain in Greece and according to legend was the home of the gods. It was here that Zeus held court and toyed with the lives and fates of mortal men. The great thrones on which Zeus and Queen Hera sat were made by their son Hephaestus, the crippled smith god who also made Zeus’ lightning bolts.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_alesia	By 52BC, Julius Caesar had won a succession of victories in his Gallic Wars, defeating several tribes and cowing others. However, with the end of his expedient political alliance with Pompey and Crassus, Caesar’s political enemies began to circle. Refused reinforcements by Rome, he faced rebellion as the Gallic tribes united under Vercingetorix of the Arverni. As Roman citizens and merchants were put to the sword across Gaul, Caesar swiftly mobilised his legions in pursuit of Vercingetorix. Harried by Caesar’s Germanic cavalry, Vercingetorix decided to regroup at the fort of Alesia. As success in an all-out assault was unlikely, Caesar laid siege to the fort to starve out the 80,000 Gauls within, ordering the circumvallation of Alesia by 18km of ditches and high fortifications. Gallic cavalry harassed the Romans during the construction, enabling a small contingent of the defenders to escape. With the possibility of the dispatch of a relief force, Caesar ordered the contravallation of the siege; another line of fortifications 21km long to protect the besiegers. With the arrival of over 100,000 Gauls to relieve the siege, the morale of Vercingetorix’s starving host was lifted. But in the days that followed, Caesar’s embattled legions repulsed all attempts to break in or out. On the final day of battle, Caesar rode amongst his legions offering encouragement, before ordering his cavalry to charge the rear of the Gallic relief force. This bold move routed the Gauls utterly, and, as they were slaughtered in retreat, Vercingetorix and his surviving allies surrendered.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_punic_fabius	“To be turned from one’s course by men’s opinions, by blame, and by misrepresentation shows a man unfit to hold an office.”  – Quintus Fabius Maximus\\n\\nQuintius Fabius Maximus (280 – 203BC) was a Roman statesman and general who held the office of Consul and Prodictator several times during the Second Punic War. He is known primarily for radically changing the traditional Roman war strategy in the face of Hannibal’s crushing victories over consular armies in the field. Fabius’ knowledge of the conflict made him the ideal man for the job. According to Livy, he was present for the failed negotiations that officialised the Second Punic War. After hours of fruitless argument, Fabius gathered a fold in his toga, stating “We bring you peace and war. Take which you will”. On the Carthaginian reply that they did not care, he dropped the fold and declared “We give you war.”\\n\\nAfter the destruction of a Roman army at Trasimene (where his predecessor was killed), the second such defeat in a row, a panicked Senate elected Fabius. He immediately initiated a new strategy of refusing Hannibal open battle, instead weathering him down through attrition and small, stinging skirmishes. Although it seemed, to many Romans, that Fabius was afraid, his fresh approach almost ensnared Hannibal on more than one occasion, and it was only the Carthaginian’s cunning and guile that saved his army from destruction.\\n\\nDespite its success, unpopularity in Rome led to the policy’s eventual abandonment in favour of brute force – a move which ultimately led to the greatest single defeat in Roman history, at Cannae in 216BC. As they recovered from the defeat and attempted to deny Hannibal the strength to attack again, this time decisively, the Romans re-adopted the Fabian strategy. It remained in-place until the end of the war - Hannibal was never able to win another victory against them.\\n\\nVindicated, Fabius opposed Scipio’s desire to fight openly in Africa, but became gravely ill and died in 203BC; he saw his strategy successfully repel Hannibal from Italy, but never lived to see his nation’s ultimate victory at Zama a year later. 	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_pompey	Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, was born in September 106BC. Like his father, he was a supporter of Sulla in his civil war against Marius. Inheriting his father’s command and legions, he was victorious over the Marian forces in Africa and Scilly. Proclaimed Imperator by his legions, he was granted the title Magnus, or “the Great”.  Subsequent victories, first Hispania and then in the East, which concluded the Third Mithridatic War, won him a further two triumphs. On his return to Rome, to secure land for his veterans, Pompey entered into the First Triumvirate with Caesar and Crassus. With his political position secured he granted himself, as consul alongside Crassus, command of Hispania. The collapse of Triumvirate, and Caesar’s subsequent crossing of the Rubicon in 49BC, sparked another civil war, pitting the two great generals against each other. Defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48BC, Pompey fled to Egypt and the court of the young Ptolemy XIII, where he was betrayed and assassinated by the king’s councillors. Upon his arrival in Egypt Caesar took bloody revenge upon the assassins, indicating that he intended to pardon his old ally following his appointment as dictator.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_teutobergerwald	One of Rome’s most bitter defeats, Teutoburg was the culmination of years of rebellion and politicking among the Germanic tribes. In all, three legions, the XVII, XVIII, and XIX, under Publius Quinctilius Varus, were lost when they walked into an ambush set by Arminius, a “trusted friend” of Rome. A chieftain of the Cherusci and an advisor to Varus, Arminius had been taken as a hostage to Rome, and later schooled in Roman military tactics. On the narrow and muddy forest tracks he directed them to take, beset by storms, the legions became strung out and easy prey for the waiting German warriors. Trying to regain control and impetus, Varus did manage to rally his legions and fortify a night camp, before breaking out the next morning. The escape was costly and, after a gruelling night march, the final slaughter saw the Romans squeezed between woodland and bogs on a narrow spit of land. Varus’ senior officer, Numonius Vala, fled with the remaining cavalry, and was cut down. Varus himself committed suicide. With three legions slaughtered, Roman forts and towns east of the Rhine were overrun. The shame of this defeat meant that the three lost legion numbers were never used again.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul_crassus	Born in 115BC, Marcus Licinius Crassus was a member of the First Triumvirate, alongside Caesar and Pompey. A supporter of Sulla in his Civil Wars against Marius, Crassus commanded the right flank at the battle of Rome’s Colline Gate in 82BC, in which the Samnites were defeated. With war over, Crassus began accumulating his fortune though the cheap auctioning of the property of proscribed persons that was forced on Marius the Younger’s defeated supporters. It was this vast wealth that bought Crassus his place in the Triumvirate, paying off Caesar’s debts and securing their later political appointments. Sharing the consulship in 55BC with Pompey, they awarded Caesar an extension of his proconsulship in Gaul, and Syria and Hispania to themselves respectively. In an attempt to match the military victories of his political allies, Crassus launched an ill-conceived war against Parthia from Syria. Defeated at the Battle of Carrhae in 53BC, Crassus’ was put to death by his Parthian captors, allegedly by having molten gold poured down his throat.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_punic_scipio	“Let us make war, since evidently, you have found peace intolerable.”  – Scipio Africanus\\n\\nThe man who became known as Scipio Africanus was the son of, and named for, Publius Cornelius Scipio, who was consul of the Roman Republic during the Second Punic War. Although the elder Scipio was eventually killed in battle in 211BC in Iberia, at the hands of Hannibal Barca’s brother, Hasdrubal, at 18 it is said the young Scipio had saved his father’s life at the Battle of Ticinus by charging the enemy with what Polybius referred to as ‘reckless daring’. He survived that battle, as well as the massacres at Trebia and Cannae. Though focused on achieving ultimate Roman victory, Scipio had endured enough personal loss to desire vengeance on Carthage, and the Barcid clan particularly.\\n\\nAlthough inexperienced, Scipio had won favour in Rome through enthusiasm and passion. Following his election to proconsul, he took the fight to Iberia - in his father’s footsteps, swiftly capturing Nova Carthago and dealing a sharp blow to the Barcids. From there, he pushed further into Iberia and shattered Carthaginian power across the peninsula following Rome’s victory at the Battle of Ilipa.\\n\\nHaving destroyed Hannibal’s Iberian powerbase, Scipio took the war to Africa and to Carthaginian home soil. He destroyed their network of alliances – crucially, with the Numidian tribes who had played such an important part in Hannibal’s early victories in Italy - before facing Hannibal himself on the final battlefield of the war, at Zama. Although the battle was close, it was ultimately decisive; Scipio countered Hannibal’s tactics and caused a mass rout of the untrained local levy. Shortly after this, the Carthaginian senate once again came to terms with Rome, giving Scipio the complete victory he had long sought. Although welcomed back to Rome triumphantly, he refused all honours offered him aside from the name ‘Africanus’, which symbolised his victory in the region.\\n\\nScipio Africanus went on to oversee Rome’s victory against the Seleucids at the Battle of Magnesia that concluded the Syrian War, before going back into politics. Following time served in office as Censor, Scipio died in approximately 193BC, after a quiet retirement spent trying, of all things, to protect his old rival, Hannibal from Rome’s vengeance.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_characters_gaul	Julius Caesar’s Gallic Wars mark a turning point in history, not just the end of tribal independence in Gaul, but also the beginning of the end for the Roman Republic. Caesar’s ten-year proconsulship as governor of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul, gained through the formation of the First Triumvirate with Pompey and Crassus, gave him both the military power and wealth to dominate Roman politics in the years that followed.\\n\\nOur best source for the Gallic Wars is Caesar’s own commentary, which tells the story from his initial actions against the migrating Helvetii, through his policy of dividing and conquering the Gallic tribes, to the quelling of subsequent rebellions, and finally the Siege of Alesia and surrender of Vercingetorix.\\n\\nAlongside his campaign in Gaul, Caesar fought a different battle against his naysayers and opponents in the Roman Senate. His political power stemmed from an expedient and fragile alliance with Pompey and Crassus, each using the other for their own ends.\\n\\nBoth Caesar’s Gallic campaign and his political manoeuvrings were an undertaking fraught with risk. Had his opposition to, and wars against, the Gallic and Germanic tribes failed, especially his dealings with the Arverni, Nervii, and Suebi, Rome itself could have paid the price, and the world as we know it could have been very different.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_cannae	By the summer of 216BC, Hannibal had won two major victories against Rome and occupied the town of Cannae. With Fabius Maximus’ strategy of cutting the Carthaginian supply lines and refusing open battle losing favour with the Roman Senate, it was now the lot of Lucius Paullus and Gaius Varro to secure victory. As command alternated daily between the two consuls, progress was sporadic. Overconfident, Varro chose to arrange his eight legions in a deep rather than wide deployment, matching Hannibal’s crescent formation, believing Hannibal had limited room to manoeuvre and that his greater numbers would break the Carthaginian lines. Hannibal was, in fact, using the Aufidus River to secure his left flank, while the Carthaginian cavalry there, under Hasdrubal, routed their opposing numbers. Hasdrubal then chased off the remaining Roman cavalry being harried on the right. Hannibal now ordered his centre to withdraw, inverting the crescent and luring the Romans forward. His African infantry stood and held the wings. Varro’s decision to deploy in depth was his downfall, as the Roman infantry found themselves hemmed in and enveloped in a pincer movement as they ploughed forward to keep in contact with the “retreating” crescent. Hannibal won a devastating victory against a numerically superior foe, and some accounts suggest that as many as 70,000 Romans died.	true

encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_nile	The Battle of the Nile in 47BC was a clash between the armies of Julius Caesar and Ptolemy XIII, the younger brother and husband of Cleopatra VII. Ptolemy had enraged Caesar in 48BC by executing Pompey the Great who had fled to Egypt; Pompey may have been a rival, but he was a Roman and Caesar’s son-in-law. Over the following months, relations went from bad to worse. In Alexandria Caesar tried to broker a peace between Ptolemy and Cleopatra. Ptolemy’s troops were trying to isolate the Romans, and were gaining the upper hand. When Caesar heard that reinforcements were nearby he marched away from Alexandria in the hope of uniting his forces. He was successful and turned on Ptolemy’s Egyptian army. The two armies, with roughly comparable forces, met on the banks of the Nile and, in true Roman style, Caesar launched the first attack. After fierce fighting the Egyptians broke and many of them fled, including Ptolemy. According to some accounts he drowned when his ship capsized on the Nile; regardless of the details, he was safely dead and no longer a problem. Caesar had brought Egypt within the Roman sphere of influence and gained the personal gratitude of Egypt’s newly-undisputed ruler, Cleopatra.	true
encyclopedia_historical_info_blocks_content_enc_text_hist_battles_zama	Following his decisive victory in Iberia, Scipio was elected consul of Rome, enabling him to attack Carthage itself and force Hannibal from Italy to defend his home soil. Assembling a mixed army of fresh volunteers and the remnants of the legions defeated at Cannae, Scipio landed in Africa in 203BC. He immediately defeated Hasdrubal Gisco at the Battle of the Great Plains with the help of the defected Numidian king, Massinissa. A desperate Carthaginian senate tried to reach a peace treaty, but the terms were considered unfavourable, a Roman fleet was soon attacked off the African coast, and the war was back on. Although many of Hannibal’s Numidian veterans remained loyal, it was the bolstering of the Roman cavalry with the same fine Numidian horsemen Hannibal had used so effectively in Italy that made the difference when he met Scipio just outside Zama Regia. This time, Hannibal had a full complement of elephants, but his army was severely depleted after so long on campaign and had to be reinforced with a large local levy, who lacked both the skill and discipline of his veterans. To make matters worse, Scipio had a plan to defeat the beasts; his cavalry blew their horns, disorientating some of the elephants and disrupting Hannibal’s left-wing, and his infantry carried out an elaborate manoeuvre, side-stepping the remaining elephants so they passed through channels in their ranks. From there, they were dealt with by fast-moving skirmishers. It was a move worthy of Hannibal himself. Scipio’s cavalry took advantage of the situation and charged into their opposite numbers, driving them from the field. As his cavalry had always out-matched the Romans, Hannibal thought they would do so again. In the ensuing melee the Carthaginian mercenaries and levy were routed, leaving Scipio’s legion facing Hannibal’s highly-experienced veterans. The resultant push of spear points proved indecisive until the victorious Roman cavalry returned, charging into the back of Hannibal’s infantry and sealing Scipio’s victory. This time, the war was over. Although Hannibal escaped, Carthage capitulated to highly unfavourable terms that prevented any further expansion and gave Rome the premise to wipe them out by the middle of the 3rd century BC.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_west_seaxe_mierce_vassal_2	According to the king of West Seaxe, he has a legitimate claim to the throne of Mierce. Once, that claim would have been vigorously opposed, but Mierce has suffered so many calamities that they seem to have lost the will to resist. They have accepted the West Seaxe claim, and become their vassals.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_west_seaxe_mierce_vassal_1	Mierce has not been a contender for some time now.

incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_welsh_unification_3	Too long has the only battle been between two invaders! The Anglo-Saxons drove the original inhabitants of these isles to the edges, and now find themselves fighting the Vikings. But the true Britons are still here. Mierce has foolishly marched into Wales but Gwined's king has marshalled his forces and subsumed his neighbours. The Sons of Rhodri Mawr are fighting back.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_welsh_unification_2	Since the death of Rhodri the Great, Wales has begun to fall back into the divisions that allowed its people to be conquered and driven to the far west. But no more. Mierce thought to take advantage, and has mounted an invasion but the King of Gwined's response was swift and decisive: he has subsumed the smaller kingdoms nearby, and now he will show the Anglo-Saxon invaders what the old Britons are capable of. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_welsh_unification_1	Mierce may have bitten off more than they can chew. They have invaded Wales but Gwined is not having any of it. Their king has co-opted the nearby factions, uniting them against the common threat from the East. For Britons who have become used to living on the margins, they are not taking this lying down!	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_west_seaxe_mierce_integrate_1	Mierce's decline has come to its logical end. West Seaxe has subsumed the old Saxon kingdom into its territories. It had to happen eventually.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_west_seaxe_mierce_integrate_3	So much for Mierce. It has been hanging on in grim determination while its borders were challenged and its people harassed, but now the West Seaxe, in their relentless drive to rule all England, have subsumed it. It seems odd to regret the passing of an Anglo-Saxon kingdom, but you cannot help but wonder if this is the future, and West Seaxe's vision of a single kingdom in this isles may one day come about.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_west_seaxe_mierce_integrate_2	Borders are being redrawn all the time, but this is a significant move.

Perhaps they have no interest in the Isles, but we should prepare for the worst.	true

Now they're turning on each other, in a cheerful orgy of violence which looks set to redraw the map. It will be interesting to see who emerges to claim the title of High King. Predictably, the Vikings who infest Eriu's ports are taking advantage, mounting their own offensive against communities weakened by Eriu's internal struggles.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_irish_wars_3	No one can accuse the Irish of shrinking from a fight.

Several of the major players amongst the Gaels have declared war on each other, each stating that their claim to be High King is legitimate.

incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_2_1	Your marauders focus their attention on the monasteries of the Frankish coast. Though the church walls are high their defenders are few, and cowardly. The riches hidden inside are soon yours. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_3_1	You surprise the Bretons. Your men are able to make off with whatever they want from their coastal settlement.

incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_4_1	Your warriors sweep aside the Iberians' attempts at resistance. They take the local produce and precious items the locals have in their homes, and a number of the locals themselves as slaves. The men's confidence grows. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_5_1	The raid on Gallaecia is an undertaking worthy of song.

incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_7_1	Your raid on Paris succeeds, and your men have the run of the island city for long enough to loot it. They break into the city's stores of silver and take as much as they can carry.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_8_1	Your warriors overcome the fortifications of Orlians and rampage through the city, taking what valuables they may from citizens' houses and breaking open the city's stores of wine.

incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_9_1	Your warriors find a weak point in Poitiers' formidable defences to exploit and they enter the town.

incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_1_3	The citizenry of Neustria turn out to defend their towns and abbeys and, fortified by a mixture of righteous anger and strong cider, manage to repel your marauders.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_2_3	The Franks rally to defend their monasteries and coastal towns. Your attempts to plunder their riches result only in casualties amongst your warriors, and no material rewards.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_3_3	Once riled, the Bretons fight as hard as any enemy your men have encountered. They beat back your marauders, then set fire to the boats they arrived in.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_4_3	Your warriors find the Iberians to be vicious when cornered. They had hoped to take some of the Iberian men as slaves but in an unexpected turnaround, most of your expedition ends up slain or enslaved.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_5_3	The Gallaecians fight hard and manage to turn the tables on your expedition. Far from coming away with a haul of slaves, your warriors are taken as slaves themselves!	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_6_3	The people of Portugale are used to fending off invaders. They never fully submitted to Rome or, most recently, to the Moors and they see off your raiders too.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_7_3	Paris deifies your marauders' best efforts, protected by the river and its high walls. When the citizens gather together to mount a counter-attack your expedition decides to withdraw.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_8_3	The resistance of the folk of Orlians is greater than your raiders anticipated. After a few unsuccessful sorties, and more losses than they would have expected, they concede defeat and give up. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_9_3	Try as they might, your warriors cannot gain entrance into Poitiers, and the town, with its eminently lootable church, remains safe on its walled promontory.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_1_2	Although the abbeys of the Neustrian coast are ill-defended, their treasures are not as rich as might have been hoped. Your warriors console themselves with the local cider. 	true

Once overcome, you find they were not defending great riches, mostly just farm produce and pottery, although your warriors enjoyed the fight.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_4_2	The Iberians fight hard to save their settlement. Several of your warriors fall fighting against them. The final reward is disappointing although some of the stronger locals will make good slaves.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_5_2	By the time your warriors have got the better of the Gallaecians the expedition has taken heavy losses. Still, the combatants who are taken prisoner now become slaves to replace those of your men who fell. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_6_2	Although their port settlement has no walls, the folk of Portugale fight hard to defend it. Some of your warriors are lost to their ambushes and traps, although the survivors reap the benefits in wine and silver coin.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_7_2	Paris is no walkover. It's citizens rush to defend the walls but you still manage to breach them long enough to raid some of the city's storehouses, and get away with a passable haul of valuables.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_8_2	Orlians resists for long enough to make your expedition falter, but the raiders are fired up, and they press through, carrying off assorted valuables and drinking all the wine they can get their hands on before leaving the locals to pick up the pieces.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_west_raid_9_2	Breaking into Poitiers is hard, due mainly to the town's natural defences. By the time your warriors scale the heights of the promontory the locals have hidden some of the local treasures, and the church does not contain as much loot as they had hoped.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_circenn_war_1	Word comes of the death of a king. The Circenn ruler has suffered a 'hunting accident' out in the hills. The priests have barely put his body in the ground before Athfochla is swooping in from the east, ready to take the vacant throne - and it looks as though Strat Clut might join them in this power grab. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_circenn_war_3	First you heard that the Circenn ruler had disappeared. Then, almost at once, word came that he had died, though no one was quite sure what of. And hot on the heels of that, there is news of Athfochla and possibly Strat Clut mobilising their armies. None of this is a coincidence. Something is rotten here, something duplicitous that your neighbours are up to their necks in. And if they can do it to Circenn...	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_circenn_war_2	When Circenn's king dies suddenly from a fever - or was it an ague? - Athfochla is suspiciously fast to step in, poised to take control before the late king's heirs have even started squabbling over the succession. Strat Clut aren't far behind them. It is almost as if both those nearby kingdoms knew in advance what was going to happen...	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_danelaw_war_3	The settled life has some benefits, but war makes you feel truly alive! The warlords who have claimed the territories of Northymbre and East Engle have had enough of sitting idle in their halls. They have marched out, wringing the last benefits from their weaker vassals, and now they will meet each other in battle, to find out which of the two might be a worthy heir to Ragnar!	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_danelaw_war_2	You are not surprised to find out that some of the Vikings who have settled in Britannia are at each others' throats. This time it is the kings of East Engle and Northymbre. They have absorbed the vassal lords who had been forced to serve them and now they intend to battle to the death for control of the east. Once a blood-thirsty invader, always a blood-thirsty invader.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_danelaw_war_1	Word comes of a new war in the east.

They are now going all out to destroy each other, and establish once and for all who has mastery of the east coast of England. 	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_dyflin_selling_slaves_8	With a decent spread of buildings to house and sell your thralls, and a steady stream of new stock coming in to sell on, you can start to read the market and hence maximise your profits. You hold a larger selection of thralls now, so you can guarantee any buyer a good choice of men for field work or women for the house.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_dyflin_selling_slaves_9	Your upgrades to the slave pens have all but banished disease from your stock of thralls. You also have a better range of thralls than you used to. Some of the women are not just comely and healthy but possess useful household skills like weaving or cooking, while the men are not merely suited to hard physical work but include a number of crafters and artisans with skills that will add to their value.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_dyflin_selling_slaves_2	Now you have somewhere to house them, you can trade more slaves. Unfortunately the thralls you have received are worn out and half dead. You only hope you can sell them on before they cough their last and go to meet their maker. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_dyflin_selling_slaves_3	Most of the slaves you have in the pens are pathetic specimens. Many are too old or infirm for serious labour, and even the younger ones are riddled with disease. You will get something for them, but are sure you can do better.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_dyflin_selling_slaves_1	Slaves are not like amber or timber. They must be fed and housed, kept in conditions at least as good as those of your livestock. If you do not do this then much of their value may be lost before they can be sold on. By building basic accommodation and a market to house and then sell the slaves you have plundered or bought, you can increase the profit from this lucrative trade.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_dyflin_selling_slaves_6	You receive a shipment of slaves who are well suited to manual work, and you have sufficient accommodation to house them. These are stolid, docile fellows, good for the fields if nothing else. They should fetch a reasonable price from farmers looking for an extra pair of hands, or merchants who want help with loading or carrying.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_dyflin_selling_slaves_7	As you build more pens to house them, you are able to be more discerning in managing your stock of thralls, separating those who may cause trouble and weeding out those who will never sell. Your increased resources and canny trading is beginning to pay dividends.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_dyflin_selling_slaves_4	Given you have room for more slaves now that you have built additional accommodation, it is a shame there are not better individuals to fill it. The thralls you are selling on at the moment are not the best, being surly and lacking in skills, stamina or pleasing looks. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_dyflin_selling_slaves_5	Your slave pens house a mixed crop at the moment. There are some young and relatively fit men who will give good service, and a few of the women have either the skills or the looks to make them valuable. However there are also a number of others who, due to injuries, age or general ill health, will not fetch much.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_dyflin_integrate_2	A second Irish longphort has fallen.

incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_-1_increase	If a ruler is ranked by the riches flowing to him then you have your work cut out. Your subjects are disgruntled at being lead by someone who appears unable to secure tribute from foreign powers.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_8	Your patience is worn thinner than the parchments your wise men have been obsessively bickering over. Neither prayer nor scholarship has solved the answer to the riddle of the Stone of Destiny's location. Your scholars say, now, that they were on the right track early on. The stone is to be found near - or perhaps under - water. They almost beg you to send your army to a settlement near a clear spring-fed pool.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_7	Your priests tell you that you have been on the wrong track in your quest for the Stone of Destiny. Britannia is a Christian land now, and the knowledge of such a valuable and holy artefact must reside with those blessed by Jesu. They have, they say, been praying for guidance without cease. You are not overly impressed, but you are also getting desperate. You allow them to put their case for sending your army to a settlement associated with a Christian saint.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_6	Shortly after you receive the disappointing but unsurprising news that the riverside settlement held nothing of interest, your scholars come to you, their mood a mixture of trepidation and excitement. They have uncovered a new text, which supports their assertion that the Stone of Destiny is hidden at a site of ancient significance. The key, they say, are the old trackways, the paths by which such powerful artefacts will have been transported around the realm. They direct you to a settlement near such an old, straight track.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_5	After another wild goose chase around the settlement near the old site, you are wondering if it is time to call your army back. But your scholars are adamant: the Stone can be found, and the small clues gathered so far will eventually lead you to it. The priests respond with contempt for the scholars' Pagan sympathies. You insist both parties confer, and they come up with a compromise: a settlement on a river which, both parties say, is a good candidate.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_4	After your army fails to find the Stone of Destiny in the ordinary surroundings of the mercantile town where you sent them on the priests' suggestion, you decide to give the scholars another chance. They insist they were on the right track, and the stone is at an ancient site - as befits an ancient artefact. Rather than an actual fort, they now say you should send your forces to a settlement near one of the many earthworks of unknown significance that dot the land.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_3	Your priests are taking a different view to your scholars when it comes to the best place to find the Stone of Destiny. Given your army found nothing at the settlement near the old fort, you concede that they may have a point. The priests say the stone will be amongst people, hidden in plain sight in a mercantile settlement. They direct your men to the most likely location.	true
incidents_localised_title_vik_traits_usurper_wife_1	Behind Every Usurper	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_2	After your army enjoys a bracing but ultimately fruitless trip to the seaside, you conclude that the Stone of Destiny is not to be found there. Your scholars now say that the kind of settlement most likely to be a hiding place for the stone would be an old military one, somewhere with a long history of occupation which would have been able to defend itself back when the Stone was a known treasure. They say they know just the place.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_1	It seems the information that sent your army to the initial location might not have been correct. When you order your scholars to look further into the matter of the Stone of Destiny they tell you that there is an important additional aspect to this mystery, and that the stone will be found near salt water. They direct your forces to an old Viking sea-port that you are holding. Now to find out if they are right.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_0	You hear tales of an ancient stone that once marked the boundary between two tracts of land, but was recently toppled in a dispute over grazing-rights. The underside of this stone bears a strange runic inscription. Your scholars are eager to examine the stone, so you send them to take a look. They return with news that the inscription refers to a second, different stone. The 'Stone of Destiny' is a long-lost treasure, said to be imbued with great power. Any ruler who possesses the Stone of Destiny will have their kingship blessed by heaven. Your wise men say the boundary-stone indicates that the Stone of Destiny is to be found at a distant settlement which you own so your men search for this wondrous artefact.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_10_decrease	This is bad. You have little in the way of material reward to show for your efforts abroad, leading to murmurs of dissatisfaction and dissent at home. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_10_increase	You need to show your mettle. A firm hand and an eye to the wider world are required if you are to gain the recognition you desire - and the tribute you deserve.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_20_decrease	You are still scraping by but to retain your place in the world ensure your peers respect you enough to pay you off, or else send out expeditions to bring back tribute from foreign lands. Or ideally, both.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_20_increase	Your fellow rulers are beginning to pay attention to you. Negotiation can bring in tribute as effectively as downright aggression, although the threat of military action remains a great motivator.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_30_decrease	Some of your subjects are becoming disillusioned. Get out in the world and secure the tribute they expect, whether by practising diplomacy, waging war or sending expeditions to distant shores.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_30_increase	If you have not already done so, now may be the time to consider bringing in tribute from farther afield. Your longships are capable of subjugating distant lands, and extracting tribute from them.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_40_decrease	Other rulers do not necessarily respect you as they should. When you threaten military action or propose a diplomatic solution, they do not always pay attention - and that means they are less likely to pay tribute.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_50_increase	Your success in securing tribute from abroad trickles down at home: when the peasants are happy and motivated then they will work harder for you. Harder working peasants means more productive farms.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_60_increase	Your subjects see you as an admirable ruler, capable of bringing in regular tribute. Beyond your lands, you are becoming a force to be reckoned with.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_70_decrease	It starts slowly, the erosion of influence. The odd refusal to give you what is due to you by a fellow king, the first lost battle, the occasional failure to subjugate a distant land. Make sure it does not become a trend. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_70_increase	Your efforts are gaining momentum. Whether through open battle or diplomatic wrangling, you are getting what is due to you - and there are always more riches to claim beyond the sea.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_tribute_80_decrease	The esteem you are held in remains high, but could be higher. You are still a ruler who is taken seriously, with a loyal populace and peers who know better than to trifle with you. However this may not always be the case…	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_mide_legitimacy_10_increase	You are on the right track, but there is still a long way to go. Make alliances and treat those you ally with well. At the same time build up your holdings locally.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_mide_legitimacy_20_decrease	Your treatment of those who would be your allies has not been exemplary, and your record at taking and holding settlements is not anything to brag about. You need to start showing your true mettle as a ruler.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_mide_legitimacy_60_decrease	It may be time to consider whether you are on the right course. You need to retain all the settlements you have gained, and be both circumspect and honourable in dealing with allies, current or potential.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_mide_legitimacy_60_increase	The improvement in your reputation gives you increased credibility across the board. People have begun to feel you can be trusted, both at home and abroad. Carry on like this and your fame and popularity will spread far and wide.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_mide_legitimacy_70_increase	Your strategies are paying off, as both your subjects and your fellow leaders now hold you in high esteem. With increased confidence comes increased opportunity: perhaps it will soon be time to consider an annexation?	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_mide_legitimacy_80_decrease	Your reputation as a leader to be admired remains intact - for now. You can count of the loyalty of the people and are spoken of well by those beyond your borders, but this may not always be the case.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_mide_legitimacy_80_increase	Only the occasional naysayer or troublemaker would question your right to rule now. Your fair treatment of friends and allies and the steady consolidation of your territory leave few in any doubt that you are the land's legitimate king.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_mide_legitimacy_90_decrease	Although your mandate to rule remains unquestioned and your people's regard is still high, this is not the time to be complacent. Such lofty standards of kingship take a lot of work to maintain.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_mide_legitimacy_90_increase	It is rare for rulers to achieve this high a level of admiration and adoration. Toasts are being drunk to you across the land. Can you go all the way, and become the king that future rulers will be compared to?	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_here_king_english_-49_increase	You have done little to date to court the favour of your English subjects, but every journey starts with a small step, and perhaps you have just taken it.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_1_2	The marsh folk are tougher than you thought. Your victory was no walkover, although your warriors still take heart from it, and even the poor pickings of this coastal region add a little to your wealth.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_2_2	The folk of Hammaburg fight hard, although victory is yours in the end. Sadly the riches you had expected from these people and their new church were more rumour than substance, and the material rewards are not great.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_3_2	Magadoburg is well fortified, and its defenders fight with the fervency of those who believe the one true God is on their side. You take the town, but lose many warriors in the process. Worse still, many of its treasures have already been smuggled out.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_4_2	The citizens of Leipsic put up a stiff resistance, though in the end the experience and ferocity of your warriors wins out. Your men wavered for a while, but their commanders assure them that not all battles will be so hard.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_5_2	Although you eventually take Dresdin, the fight is long and arduous. Many fine warriors fall before you can claim victory.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_6_2	The battle for Groningen is not easy, as its citizens pull together to defend themselves, but - perhaps encouraged by the thought of the local beer - your warriors win through eventually.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_7_2	There is life in the old port yet. The citizens of Dorestad put on a brave fight, and you take heavy losses before managing to subdue them. Your warriors win, just. They hope for a better result next time. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_8_2	The citizens of Genua are used to standing up for themselves, and muster to fight off your incursion, putting up a disciplined resistance. The city falls to you, but not without losses.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_9_2	The city's walls are a challenge, and though you trick your way past them to gain access, the cost in men is heavy. To add insult to injury, it turns out this is not the city of Rome but a smaller, poorer settlement called Luni.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_1_3	To your surprise and consternation, the marsh folk of Lehe stand firm against your attempt to conquer them. The expedition returns depleted in men and supplies, and with nothing to show for its efforts.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_2_3	Though their settlement may not be long established, the people of Hammaburg manage to repulse your attack. The expedition returns home with a sorry tale of defeat, and nothing else.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_3_3	The people of Magadoburg must have been expecting trouble. They fight back, slaying many of your warriors and setting fire to their ships. You have nothing to show for your efforts.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_4_3	The folk of Leipsic fight back with unexpected skill and vigour, repulsing your warriors' attack. Between the spirited counter-attack of the Saxlanders and the long journey back, few of your men return home.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_5_3	The settlement of Dresdin was not the walkover you might have thought. Not only do your warriors not only fail to take it, but most of the expedition is never heard from again.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_6_3	The people of Groningen are used to squabbling with their neighbours, and are prepared for the attack. They see off your warriors.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_7_3	Dorestad did not endure for centuries without being able to defend itself, and it has faced invaders like you before. Its citizens mobilise and to drive off your warriors. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_8_3	The citizens of Genua are not the soft targets you initially thought. They fight back with discipline and courage, and your forces are ravaged.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_9_3	The smooth white city walls confound your attack. You do not now believe this city to be Rome itself - it is too small - but as you have failed to conquer it, you may never know.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_1_1	Your warriors easily overcome the fishermen and farmers of Lehe. The men are cheered by this victory and the coastal Saxlanders yield tribute to you. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_2_1	You take Hammaburg. The riches from its great church make a fitting tribute and your warriors and their commanders are greatly pleased to conquer a town with such great potential.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_3_1	You defeat the defenders of the fortress of Magadoburg, and your men gleefully sack their monastery. The church holds treasures crafted in silver from the mines nearby, which comes to you as tribute.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_4_1	Your warriors do battle with the defenders of Leipsic, and prevail. The town is now yours. With this victory comes tribute and increased self-confidence amongst those who fight for your cause. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_5_1	Your expedition overcomes Dresdin's defences, and take the town. Adding such a conquest to your territory is a worthy achievement, and leaves your warriors ready to face new challenges.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_6_1	Your warriors triumph over the citizens of Groningen, leaving the expedition in a buoyant mood. You get a rich tribute of grain and beer from these Frisians. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_7_1	Your warriors take the old trading hub of Dorestad. Bringing a once-famous port low increases the men's resolve to make future conquests. The old coins hoarded by the townsfolk are now tribute to your might.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_8_1	The partially-built walls of Genua provide insufficient protection for its citizens. You add the city to your conquests and your warriors rejoice at getting such an easy foothold in the warm southern lands.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_conquer_9_1	You take this city with its seemingly impenetrable walls, after employing some subterfuge to gain access. It turns out not to be Rome after all, but a smaller settlement called Luni. The conquest is still one worth celebrating.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_circenn_destiny_stone_found	Your priests and scholars have pored over ancient writings, argued with each other, and changed their minds far too many times. Your warriors have marched across the length and breadth of Britannia, taking locations where the Stone was rumoured to be found, and holding them against all comers.

Our best generals demand we remain vigilant however, as even the mighty Roman Empire succumbed to foreign incursions. Maybe we should strengthen our military presence, just in case?	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_dyflin_brega_3	The King of Dyflin is expanding his territory though not by the usual means. He has managed to take control of Brega, the independent territory to the north, without having to mount a full-scale invasion. Perhaps there was a little raiding, just to soften the enemy up, but in the end some talk, some money, and the threat of further violence were enough to secure new lands. Perhaps this is the way of the future... 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_dyflin_brega_2	It seems the Viking pirates who now call themselves kings are indeed learning other ways to get what they want, beside the axe and sword. Dyflin has taken control of once-independent Brega, without blood being shed, if accounts are true. No doubt underhand payments and the threat of serious violence were involved.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_incident_ai_dyflin_brega_1	Not content with holding the port at Dyflin, the Viking sea kings who settled on Eriu's east coast have made a move on their independent neighbours to the north. Whether they bribed or intimidated the King of Brega you may never know, but the result is the same: Dyflin now controls Brega's territory.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_1_3	The people of Lehe may only be farmers and fisher-folk, but they put up an spirited defence of their marshlands, and your warriors come away empty-handed.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_2_3	Their new religion has put fire in the belly of the folk of Hammaburg! They repulse your raiders' attack without taking serious losses.	true

incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_1_2	Your men got away with a few scraps - mainly the fish and mutton the Saxlanders themselves eat - but it was hardly the riches you had hoped for.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_2_2	Inspired by religious fervour, the folk of Hammaburg fight back. You steal some of their church's silverware, and a few useless books, before they see off your raiders. 	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_3_2	Either rumours of Magadoburg's riches were exaggerated, or the locals managed to hide most of them before your raiders turned up.

incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_4_2	Rich though the town looked, it seems Leipsic's wealth is in its forests. Timber is hardly a transportable treasure, so your raid comes back with little to show save a few odd trinkets from the townsfolk.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_5_2	The citizens of Dresdin do an unexpectedly good job of defending their town, and manage to take down a number of your raiders. Your raiding party gets away with a few iron ingots and some slaves.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_6_2	After several hard-fought skirmishes your men enter Groningen.

incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_8_2	The Genuans' efforts to defend themselves are haphazard, but enough to slow your raiders. The plunder to be had is not great, being mainly local produce and crafts rather than anything of great value.	true
incidents_localised_description_vik_sea_king_expedition_south_raid_9_2	Although your expedition manages to trick its way past the city walls, they find it is not Rome after all, but a far smaller settlement called Luni. The pickings are correspondingly not as rich as they had hoped.	true

Between fertile low hills and lowland marshes, it is a quiet place of plenty - or was, when Northymbre held sway. It is now part of the Danelaw and the people of Lude have no love for the Vikings, after they attacked their monastery and killed their bishop. They would most likely welcome your rule.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_fact_dyflin_mission_brega	In order to secure our position in Ireland we need to secure out foothold on the coast. Conquer the province of Brega!	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_1_3	It would be quite a coup to control the church at Hwitan Aerne. It may be one of the oldest churches in Britannia and Saint Ninian, who was educated in Rome and is credited with bringing the faith of Jesu to Alba, is said to be buried there. To be in possession of such a centre of learning and piety would reflect very well on you.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_2_3	The Monastery at Rath Luraig, on the edge of the Kingdom of Ailecah, is old and rich. Not as old as the fort there, which has long since fallen into disrepair and become a place of ghosts and legends. Perhaps those older powers still linger, though they are nothing to warriors armed with stalwart wills and cold iron.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_3_3	Situated at the southern-most end of the greatest peninsula on Alba's western coast, the fort of Dun Aberte is surrounded on three sides by the sea. This rocky headland was fortified by the kings of Dal Riata and is now a formidable redoubt, accessible only via a drawbridge on the northern approach. Take this fort and you will command all you survey.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_4_3	Mailros is an abbey and settlement on the bend of a lowland river in southern Alba. The church there, said to be founded by the earliest Christians in these isles on an old Roman site, holds extensive lands, and the area thereabout is famed for its sheep farming. The combination of ecclesiastical status and material wealth is very attractive.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_5_3	The port of Cairlinn lies on a narrow inlet and is backed by a small mountain. Around the mountain the fields are fertile and well-managed, and the mudflats of the inlet provide shellfish and other useful resources. Given the wealth and plenty of its environs and its strategic position, Cairlinn would be a shrewd acquisition.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_6_3	Loch Raich, the town by the Grey Lake, is the site of a monastery but shows signs of far older beliefs. Ancient stones still stand on the nearby hill, perhaps raised by giants or druids, along with a great stone table, said to be used by legendry heroes engaged in drinking contests. More mundanely, the woodland round here is rich with game, and the lake home to abundant fish and wildfowl. This place would be a worthy acquisition.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_7_3	A stone fort guards the settlement of Cathair Domnaill.  The land hereabout is ruggedly beautiful and though the rocky terrain is not suited to farming, save for a few hardy sheep, there is treasure below the earth in the form of copper ore, which has been mined here since before Roman times.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_8_3	Heslerton is a bustling town, with regular markets. It is surrounded by excellent farmland, good both for growing crops and raising livestock, as well as having productive woodland, after which the settlement was named -  the 'hazel enclosure'. Though Heslerton now under the Danelaw, this should not stop you from claiming it for your own.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_9_3	Whatever settlement originally existed at Tureceseig, it is now lost. The Great Viking Army made their winter camp here recently, and appear to have settled in, even setting up smithies and kilns. It is fortified, but not impregnable, and to take a site where the Vikings feel so at home would damage both their material interests and their morale.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_1_2	Din Prys has been settled since before the Romans came, and it is easy to see why. Sheltered in a river valley, the settlement oversees some of the best farmland in Alba, while also acting as a bustling inland port with good natural defences. Having this nearby land of plenty under your control can only be a good thing.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_2_2	Coinnire is a holy place that was once owned by the old Kingdom of Dal Riata, and is now in the province of Ulaid. It is associated with Saint Patrick's early life and there is a monastery just across the river. The church brings prosperity and status, so to hold this settlement would increase both your wealth and your standing as a ruler.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_3_2	The hillfort at Dun Duirn is a well-fortified site. The location is a natural steep-side mound rising high over the floodplain of the River Earn in the disputed heart of Alba, with a clear view down all the surrounding mountain passes. Canny rulers have made the most of the existing terrain, and added solid walls. This has turned Dun Duirn into a valuable military site well worth occupying.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_4_2	The old hillfort at Dynbaer looks out across the sea lanes of the North. Saint Cuthbert, so revered by the Christians of Northhymbre, was said to have come from here. Unlike much of Alba it is also relatively flat and fertile, well suited to growing crops such as oats and barley. It would be a valuable addition to your lands.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_5_2	There has been a monastic settlement at Cluain Eoais, in the fragmented lands of the Airgialla, for many generations. The countryside round about is often waterlogged but the church itself is rich - rich enough that they are building a great tower, high enough to reach the clouds, to add to their glory. Owning this settlement would prove your power to the people of Eriu.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_6_2	The church at Saighir is one of the oldest in Eriu, centrally located to allow easy dissemination of the new religion. Its first Bishop, Saint Ciaran, was a Pagan convert and one legend claims he was given a clapperless bell by Saint Patrick. Eriu's greatest saint told the convert to found a holy house where the bell sounded - and it did so near the bubbling spring here. Whether the legend is true or not this is a sanctified location, respected by all around, and owning it will add to your personal glory.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_7_2	The prosperous town of Druim Collachair holds regular markets. Located in the abundant farming country of south-west Eriu this settlement can provide rich rewards for a ruler who can take and hold it.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_8_2	On confluence of two rivers and an old Roman road, Alclyt is well-placed in every sense. The farmland nearby is productive, and the forests beyond are full of game, including deer and boar. You would be wise to take and hold this settlement, even though it falls under the Danelaw.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_9_2	Drayton, a small settlement with its own abbey, sits in arable farmland on the edge of damp fenland. The rich soil here gives a reliable harvest, and though it has not prospered under the Danelaw, taking and holding this compact town with the capacity to re-stock your granaries would be a sensible move.	true

It was the stronghold of Rhydderch Hael, one of the warlords of Britannia in the days before the Saxons and other invaders troubled these shores. Rhydderch Hael was a contemporary of Saint Columba, and fought alongside one of the other great rulers of the time, Urien of Rheged.

missions_localised_description_vik_northymbra_ragnars_legacy_raid_1	There are those amongst your court who claim kinship to Ragnar. Not by blood perhaps, given how the Anglo-Saxons hunted down his line after dealing him a coward's death, but in spirit. In many ways, all of your folk are the sons and daughters of Ragnar. With this in mind, mount a raid upon your enemies, to take what the Anglo-Saxon cowards have as revenge for what they took from you and your people.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_northymbra_ragnars_legacy_raid_3	This war has got the people's blood up. There is much talk of Ragnar, of the vile abuse visited on him by the Anglo-Saxons. They could not even honour him with a warrior's death, and instead had him hog-tied and cast into a pit of snakes, to die in lonely agony in the dark. The pain of this indignity lives on for you and your people. Now the descendants of those who dared this craven act will suffer as you take the fight to them. Order your warriors to raid their settlement, showing no mercy to those they find there.	true

One is the great Fair of Tailtiu, which Mide usually hosts, as your lands are at the heart of Eriu. This year it is neither practical nor politic to try and put on such a celebration. In times of peace the Fair draws folk from across Eriu, and to not hold it is a matter of concern. Thinking on this, you decide that the time has come to reconsider your martial ambitions.

missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_occupy_vik_reg_cetretha	Cetretha was the site of a noble defeat. According to the bard Aneirin, a small but highly skilled band of warriors drawn from across Britannia - including Gwined - were assembled by Mynyddog Mwynfawr, ruler of the land of Gododdin. After feasting and building their strength at his stronghold of Eidenburg, they marched south to face the invaders from the East who threatened the lands of the Old North. They met at Cetretha, but were outnumbered. Despite fighting valiantly, the Britons lost. Perhaps it is time to right that wrong, and take Cetretha for yourself.	true

missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_alliance_vik_reg_loidis	The riverside settlement of Loidis was one of the most important towns in the kingdom of Elmet. Though Arthur probably never ruled here, his example inspired the Britons of Elmet, allowing them to hold out against invasion for many years before finally being attacked, and overcome, by the English kingdom of Northymbre. Later, the Vikings came and took Loidis for themselves, making it part of the Danelaw. Now it is ruled by true Britons again, and they might make useful allies.	true

missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_occupy_vik_reg_doneceaster	Cadwallon was Gwined's greatest warlord. On marshland near Doneceaster, Cadwallon defeated and killed King Edwin of Northymbre. Edwin, a long-time rival, had encroached deep into Cadwallon's territory but Cadwallon fought back, entering into an alliance with Penda of Mierce and marching on Northymbre. After defeating Edwin Cadwallon went on to rule Northymbre for a year, a reign which later English writers viewed as tyrannical but which all true Britons see as an inspiration. What better way to remember this great victory than to take Doneceaster for yourself.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_alliance_vik_reg_carleol	Urien was a warlord to inspire all true Britons, said to have fought alongside Arthur himself. He ruled Rheged, one of the lands of the Old North, and his court bard was the master poet Taliesin. Carleol, which had been a settlement of importance since ancient times, is thought to have been Urien's capital. This town overlooking the mountains was taken by Rome and incorporated into their great wall. After Urien's time it fell, inevitably, to the invaders from the East, and more recently it has been ravaged by the Vikings. But now it is in Welsh hands, which is a thought to lift the heart. Perhaps you should ally with them.	true

The legend goes that his advisor Merlin, so distraught at the scale and brutality of the bloodshed he witnessed, fled into the forest, where he remained for a year and a day before recovering his wits.

Though the Vikings besieged and then ravaged this rocky fortress, it is now in the hands of Welsh ruler, and an alliance might be politic. 	true

missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_occupy_vik_reg_casteltoun	Castletoun is the main settlement on the Isle of Mana, and is a fortified community of fisherfolk with an abbey nearby. The inhabitants of Castletoun are said to favour a system of governance for their isle which gives the common people a say in how their land is run. It seems unlikely this will catch on. Mana has recently been claimed as Viking territory, which is no surprise, given its strategically important position, overlooking routes that cross three seas. It is also not far from Gwined, so perhaps you should take Castletoun for yourself.	true

missions_localised_description_vik_northymbra_ragnars_legacy_fight_1	Ragnar's memory lives on. The Anglo-Saxon dogs hid behind their priests and lawmakers, men who have never even held a sword, when they dared condemn one of the greatest warriors the world has ever known to a coward's death. To redress this affront, order your warriors to attack the Anglo-Saxons who threaten the lands you and your people have fought so hard to win and keep.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_northymbra_ragnars_legacy_fight_2	These Anglo-Saxons do not know the meaning of valour. Your people still speak of the death of Ragnar, bound like some common criminal then thrown into a pit of snakes to die a death no man of honour should have to endure.  You hear their mutterings, and they touch your warrior's heart. There is only one response to such an outrage, and that is to fight back without ceasing. Dispatch warriors to attack the nearest enemy force at once, as payback for Ragnar's fall.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_northymbra_ragnars_legacy_fight_3	A man comes to you saying he is of Ragnar's line, asking whether you have forgotten how his kinsman was treated. It still rankles that one of the greatest of the Vikings should be executed with no chance to fight back, dying alone in the dark. The best way to avenge Ragnar's suffering is to order your warriors to hunt down and destroy the nearest force of Anglo-Saxons.	true

Offa, arguably Mierce's greatest ruler, was buried here, although his tomb was later washed away by the river, perhaps a judgement on his harsh treatment of your folk.

missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_alliance_vik_reg_hagustaldes	Cadwallon of Gwined was a great hero, fighting back against English oppression to defeat King Edwin of Northymbre and take his throne. Oswald, one of the few surviving members of Edwin's family, raised an army to take back his kinsman's lands. Cadwallon met Oswald's army at the Battle of the Wall, near Hagustaldes, and lost. Oswald hunted down and killed Cadwallon, ending an all-too-brief period of resurgence for the true Britons.

Rumour has it the inhabitants are considering a system of governance which gives the common people a say in how their land is run - a most peculiar idea.

Under his leadership, the Britons drove the invaders back to the very coast and into the sea near Bebbanburg. But the victory was soured when one of Urien's allies betrayed him, and had him killed.

One is the location, stated only as being near a ford, although learned men have since claimed it could be Gleawceaster. If so, then the other mystery, which was the exact composition of the army this great warlord defeated, would be solved: it would have been the invading Saxons.

Perhaps you should take it for yourself, and provide the support its people need - it return for a goodly percentage of their produce.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_11_3	The settlement of Ebbesham lies near a clear spring, at the edge of low chalk hills. The farming is good here, and the locals wealthy.

missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_12_3	The hill fort at Cissanbyrig was here when the Romans came. In their day the fortifications were multi-layered and impressive.

missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_13_3	The coastal town of Waecet gets much of its wealth from the sea, as there is only limited farmland along the shore. Beyond the shoreline the terrain rises to upland heaths, although these uplands do hold stores of potentially valuable ore. The settlement's position alone makes it important, and it is being fortified by the West Seaxe - a wise precaution, given the Vikings have taken to over-wintering on the nearby isle of Steep Holm. Perhaps you should beat them to it.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_14_3	The settlement of Lann Dewi sits on the river at the edge of mountains in southern Wales, near the site of an old Roman road. Its fame comes from Wales' Saint David, who was said to have addressed a great crowd here during his mission to spread the message of Jesu. When he realised some in the crowd could not hear him, he raised the ground up under himself, forming a mound that the church now stands on. To possess such a location would show your own wisdom and might.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_10_2	Though founded by the Saxons, Huntadun is now home to a semi-permanent Viking camp. Ermine Street, the great Roman road running south to north along though Britannia's eastern side, passes through Huntadun, and it is a hub for the produce from nearby farmsteads.  You can see why the raiders might want to possesses this place - and so, perhaps, should you.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_11_2	The Romans made the town once called Verulamium a major centre of civilisation, though these days Sancte Albanes is best known as the resting place of the Saint whose name it later took. Saint Alban was an early Christian martyr and there has been a church of some form here for as long as the religion of Jesu has been known in these isles. A truly sanctified place, well worth occupying.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_12_2	Suthhamtunam was founded by the Romans, who saw the advantage of a port at the head of a sheltered inlet.

Like many rich coastal towns it has suffered from Viking raids, but it remains unbowed, and a potentially valuable possession.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_13_2	Cridiatune is the birthplace of Saint Boniface, who took the message of Jesu to the Franks on the continent. Situated as it is in a vale between two hills, the land thereabout is not well-cultivated save for some upland grazing, mainly for sheep, but the church is rich enough to make this a settlement worth occupying.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_14_2	The lake of Lann Cors, lying at the foot of sheep-dotted highlands, teems with fish and waterfowl and perhaps even a lake monster, though there are no reliable accounts of this beast, possibly because - according to some - it is invisible. The settlement at Llan Cors is centred round a fort of sturdy oak and local stone, built out on the lake, to which its inhabitants can withdraw in times of trouble. Trouble might be just what you bring, should you decide to possess these rich waters.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_10_1	Standing proud on its island above the fens, Elig is a settlement with a long history, most likely named for the eels which can be easily caught hereabouts.

Though unprepossessing in aspect, and surrounded by fetid marshes, its position where the river narrows and bends makes Tilaburg strategically important. You might be wise to add it to your holdings.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_12_1	The settlement of Middeherst grew up in the wooden downland where two routes - north-south and east-west - met at a crossroads. The meadows of the nearby river produce rich pasturage for local livestock, and the river itself waters arable farms that keep the small town's inhabitants well-fed. They have prosperity to share.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_13_1	Brideport, the market on the river Brid, is an up-and-coming place.  Its harbour, a little way out of the town itself, is a bustling fishing port and the main settlement is on a main route to the west, set in good sheep country. However, its growing importance comes mainly from the West Seaxe decision to fortify Brideport against the Viking menace and, rumour has it, set up a mint there. Whether these fortifications will stop you remains to be seen.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_strat_clut_map_control_14_1	Cair Mirddin was named for the sorcerer Merlin, who is said to have lived there - some legends claim he lies imprisoned in a hill near the town to this day. The Romans built the town up to one of the largest in Wales: it even had its own amphitheatre. Cair Mirddin is a river port, and the locals build fine coracles, used for fishing when a net is strung between them.  A town with both history and resources, well worth occupying.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_sudreyar_assembly_blockade_1	After some discussion, your Thing suggests a new way to hurt the enemy: cut off their supply lines. Order your fleet to blockade one of the enemy's ports and they will no longer be able to receive seaborne supplies or send out their own ships. Your foes will not be able to field such an effective fighting force, and their morale will suffer, while your own warriors will take heart from their misfortune.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_sudreyar_assembly_blockade_2	The nobles of your Thing come to you with a suggestion. They say you should mount a blockade of one of the ports belonging to a potential future foe. This will have a number of effects, including demoralising your neighbours, taxing their resources and allowing your longships more freedom to ply the seas and mount raids and trading missions.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_sudreyar_assembly_blockade_3	During discussions of possible future expeditions your Thing comes up with the idea of blockading a nearby port. Tying up your neighbours in this way will give clear passage to your own ships when they set out to reach distant lands and bring back the bounty to be acquired there.	true

missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_occupy_vik_reg_cirenceaster	Cirenceaster was a stronghold of the Romans in Britannia, built on one of their major roads and graced with a large amphitheatre, a forum and high stone walls. Like many other Roman towns, the settlement went into decline after Rome left, until the Saxons fought the Britons to claim the site for their own. Not that they could agree who owned it, as Cirenceaster saw a battle between the warlords of Mierce and West Seaxe not long after those two usurping 'kingdoms' were founded. The land here is excellent for farming, most especially for raising sheep. Cirenceaster would be worth taking.	true

missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_alliance_vik_reg_doneceaster	Cadwallon is remembered as Gwined's strongest warlord, and he fought his greatest battle near Doneceaster. King Edwin of Northymbre had overshadowed Cadwallon for much of his life, more recently claiming parts of Gwined for his own. In response, Cadwallon formed an alliance with Penda of Mierce, and together they defeated and killed Edwin and his heir. Cadwallon went on to rule Northymbre for a year, a reign which later English writers viewed as tyrannical but which is an inspiration to all true Britons. This territory is back in the hands of the Welsh, and you may wish to ally yourself with them.	true

missions_localised_description_vik_gwined_legendary_battle_occupy_vik_reg_carleol	The land of Rheged was part of the Old North, the loose alliance of domains formed after the Romans left and before the invaders from the continent over-ran much of Britannia. Urien, who may have been a contemporary of Arthur, was Rheged's greatest ruler, and Carleol is said to have been his capital. Urien was blessed by having the services of one of Britannia's legendary bards, Taliesin, and much of what is known of the land of Rheged before the vile invaders drove out the Britons comes from this poet's pen. Carleol's importance to true Britons makes it worth taking.	true

missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_0_1	You hear tales of an ancient stone that once marked the boundary between two tracts of land, but was recently toppled in a dispute over grazing-rights. The underside of this stone bears a strange runic inscription. Your scholars are eager to examine the stone, so you send them to take a look. They return with news that the inscription refers to a second, different stone. The 'Stone of Destiny' is a long-lost treasure, said to be imbued with great power. Any ruler who possesses the Stone of Destiny will have their kingship blessed by heaven. Your wise men say the boundary-stone indicates that the Stone of Destiny is to be found at a distant settlement, which you should occupy while your men search for this wondrous artefact.  	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_1_1	It seems the information that sent your army to the initial location might not have been correct. When you order your scholars to look further into the matter of the Stone of Destiny they tell you that there is an important additional aspect to this mystery, and that the stone will be found near salt water. They direct your forces to a sea-port now favoured by the Vikings. This, they say, is a good candidate location. Occupy the port, and you will find out if they are right.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_2_1	After your army enjoys a bracing but ultimately fruitless trip to the seaside, you conclude that the Stone of Destiny is not to be found there. Your scholars now say that the kind of settlement most likely to be a hiding place for the stone would be an old military one, somewhere with a long history of occupation which would have been able to defend itself back when the Stone was a known treasure. They say they know just the place.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_3_1	Your priests are taking a different view to your scholars when it comes to the best place to find the Stone of Destiny. Given your army found nothing at the settlement near the old fort, you concede that they may have a point. The priests say the stone will be amongst people, hidden in plain sight in a mercantile settlement. They direct your men to the most likely location.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_4_1	After your army fails to find the Stone of Destiny in the ordinary surroundings of the mercantile town where you sent them on the priests' suggestion, you decide to give the scholars another chance. They insist they were on the right track, and the stone is at an ancient site - as befits an ancient artefact. Rather than an actual fort, they now say you should send your forces to a settlement near one of the many earthworks of unknown significance that dot the land. 	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_5_1	After another wild goose chase around the settlement near the old site, you are wondering if it is time to call your army back. But your scholars are adamant: the Stone can be found, and the small clues gathered so far will eventually lead you to it. The priests respond with contempt for the scholars' Pagan sympathies. You insist both parties confer, and they come up with a compromise: a settlement on a river which, both parties say, is a good candidate.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_6_1	Shortly after you receive the disappointing but unsurprising news that the riverside settlement held nothing of interest, your scholars come to you, their mood a mixture of trepidation and excitement. They have uncovered a new text, which supports their assertion that the Stone of Destiny is hidden at a site of ancient significance.  The key, they say, are the old trackways, the paths by which such powerful artefacts will have been transported around the realm. They direct you to a settlement near such an old, straight track.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_7_1	Your priests tell you that you have been on the wrong track in your quest for the Stone of Destiny. Britannia is a Christian land now, and the knowledge of such a valuable and holy artefact must reside with those blessed by Jesu. They have, they say, been praying for guidance without cease. You are not overly impressed, but you are also getting desperate. You allow them to put their case for sending your army to occupy a settlement associated with a Christian saint.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_8_1	Your patience is worn thinner than the parchments your wise men have been obsessively bickering over. Neither prayer nor scholarship has solved the answer to the riddle of the Stone of Destiny's location. Your scholars say, now, that they were on the right track early on. The stone is to be found near - or perhaps under - water. They almost beg you to send your army to a settlement near a clear spring-feed pool. 	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_0_2	An old hermit comes to your hall with a strange tale. He says he had a dream of a holy artefact, the Stone of Destiny. You have come across fleeting references to such an object, and you give him leave to speak. He says the time is right for the Stone to be found. Whoever finds it will be much blessed, and any ruler who holds the Stone in their possession will be a great leader. You have your priests and scholars interview the man at length, though his health is failing and his story not always coherent. However, your wise men conclude that he speaks truly. They even come up with a possible location, and they recommend you occupy the settlement there, in order to give your men time to find the Stone. 	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_1_2	It appears the Stone of Destiny will not be so easy to find. Your wise men say the vital component, missed in the initial enthusiastic rush to claim this treasure, was water. Specifically, salt water. The Stone is near the sea, they say. After further consultation they suggest you direct your forces to occupy the trading port where they believe it may be found. 	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_2_2	The sea-port, after thorough searching, turned up little of interest. Your scholars think they may have been too hasty in sending your men to the sea and given their lack of success you can only concur. Somewhat embarrassed, one of your scholars admits that what they read as 'port' might actually have been 'fort'.  They have a new settlement in mind, near one of the ancient and now-abandoned hillforts built by long-dead warriors. 	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_3_2	The reason you have not yet found the Stone of Destiny, according to your priests, is that its location is not tied to an old site with Pagan associations, but to a modern Christian settlement. Somewhere that  exists for commerce and craft, not because of ancient ruins. They know of several candidate towns, and when you command them to stop talking and reach a decision, they do. You send your army to the location they indicate.  	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_4_2	Given your army found no sign of the Stone of Destiny in the town you sent them to, you are starting to wonder if the priests and scholars are just bickering for the sake it. However, when one of your scholars come to you saying that such an ancient artefact must be in a place of great antiquity, you can see his point. He says you should seek it where the dead were interred in times beyond memory, and directs you to look at a settlement which has an old and hallowed burial-site nearby. Seeing little to lose, you send your army there.  	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_5_2	No sign of the Stone - again. Some of your warriors are muttering about the futility of this quest, and whilst you will make sure any such dissent is quashed, they do have a point. You issue your wise men with an ultimatum: put your heads together and come up with a more promising lead! The priests and scholars duly go into conference, and after much discussion, send a representative to tell you that they have agreed on a location, a settlement by a river.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_6_2	Your army found no sign of the stone at the riverside settlement, which did not surprise you. However, your scholars come to you humbly and apologetically, and point out that every new journey does turn up additional clues, and they are working hard on the texts. They add that they have recently come across a new vellum of great antiquity, which speaks of old and valuable items hidden along ancient paths. They even have a settlement near such an old track in mind. You decide you may as well try here, as you've looked everywhere else.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_7_2	The priests who advise you now humbly submit that the lack of success in finding the Stone of Destiny could be down to a lack of piety. After praying and fasting they say that the Stone must be found in a place sacred to Jesu himself. The location they indicate was the home of an early Christian convert who was martyred for his beliefs. His sacrifice sanctified the settlement that grew up after his death, and you will find what you seek there.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_8_2	Somewhat shame-facedly, a delegation of scholars comes to you to say that there was another mistranslation in one of the texts they were referring to. This one referred to the Stone of Destiny being found near water. They had thought this meant the sea, or possibly a river, but now they are sure it was fresh water, a spring or pool or well. Putting this new knowledge together with the clues gleaned so far, they are convinced they have the right location. You are not so sure, but you decide to indulge them once last time. 	true

missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_0_3	While poring over an ancient parchment, recently discovered in the vaults of a monastery, your priests come across a reference to the 'Stone of Destiny'. The Stone confers the blessings of heaven on the ruler who possesses it. Elsewhere in the parchment they find references of a location which, whilst not named, they believe they can pin down by its description.  At their urging you send a party to occupy the settlement they indicate, to search it and find if these learned men spoke truly.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_1_3	With no sign of the Stone of Destiny at the location your army initially occupied, you order your wise men to revisit what they know. They tell you that the missing element was salt water. The Stone of Destiny, they say, may be found near the sea. They have a specific sea-port in mind, and they say you should send an occupying force there, to hold the town and search it at leisure.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_2_3	The Stone of Destiny was not to be found at the port settlement. The scholars say a different kind of old settlement is a far more likely candidate. Something as precious as this artefact would require hiding or defending, and so a logical place to look would be at an old, fortified site. Most likely it would be somewhere now settled and quiet, perhaps even with few traces of its military past. They even have a location in mind.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_3_3	Your army's stay in the settlement near the fort was fruitless. Your priests say you should not listen to your scholars, with their fondness for the old Pagan ways. True wisdom comes only from God. Forget the Pagan past, with tales of old battles and wind-blown forts. Look to ordinary settlements of God-fearing folk as a home for the Stone of Destiny. When you ask which ordinary settlement of God-fearing folk, they have an answer for you. You decide to indulge them, and send your army there.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_4_3	Your army did not find the Stone of Destiny in the ordinary settlement where the priests sent them. They did find a well-travelled wise man who appeared to have some knowledge of the Stone, and given none of your own wise men have managed to get you any closer to claiming it, you decide to heed his word. This seer says the site of the Stone is guarded by an ancient tree.  Given such sites are revered both by the scholars who respect the old ways and the priests who see such trees as a manifestation of Jesu's cross, this solution would suit both the scholars and the priests. You decide to occupy the town nearest the gnarled and sacred tree the seer spoke of. 	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_5_3	Given your 'wise men' have - yet again! - failed to find the Stone, and your army is getting tired of traipsing round after rumours, you decide to look into other sources. Your spies bring you an account of odd goings-on in a settlement on a river. Both the priests and scholars, aware that your patience is not infinite, agree this may be worth following up. At this stage, you'll take any lead you can get. You send the army to the settlement on the river. 	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_6_3	The town by the river yields nothing. Your scholars, aware that you are upset at this latest setback, are quick to assure you that their knowledge grows all the time. Even now, they are deciphering texts they had not previously consulted. Their latest finding speaks of powerful artefacts being found near the old roadways, paths that have been used to transport items of value from time before memory. As a result they suggest - humbly but with some confidence - that you send your army to settlement near such an old road.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_7_3	The priests are not happy. Then again, neither are you. They say you have given too much weight to the words of the scholars with their ungodly reliance on knowledge from the time before Jesu came to these lands. You say you are not concerned with whose lore is right - you just want to find the Stone of Destiny! The priests respond that they have prayed and fasted to gain holy wisdom, and received guidance saying that you must look to a settlement near a holy Christian site, once home to a pious hermit. With a hearty sigh, you despatch your army.	true
missions_localised_description_vik_circenn_stone_of_destiny_8_3	It seems the initial prediction from your scholars, that the Stone might be found near salt water, was not quite right. Curbing your anger at this understatement, you ask them to clarify. They say they were close from the start, but the water in question must be pure and sweet, not salty. So not the sea, and not a river. They know of many holy wells and pools and have taken the clues from other locations into account to come up with what they claim is a sure bet. Could this be it? You send the army, but you are not holding your breath. 	true

resources_long_description_res_vik_leather	People have been using hides to protect and clothe themselves ever since they could trap and kill animals. Archaeological evidence for this goes back to the Palaeolithic period. As animal husbandry was developed, the use and availability of hides increased. Tanning evolved to make more durable and versatile leather instead of rawhide. Documentary evidence of tanning goes back, as is so often the case, to the Egyptians. All manner of fairly repulsive substances were used to tan leather, from tannins in tree bark to faeces and animal brains. Tanning was a smelly, dirty and even lethally poisonous trade, and it was usually banished to the outskirts of towns. The leather produced was extremely useful, and this compensated for the foul process. Waterskins, bags, boats, armour, sandals, boots, scabbards, harnesses, and much else besides.	true

resources_long_description_res_vik_copper	Copper is the oldest known metal in the world, dating back many centuries BC. It is also one of the only metallic elements that occurs in the natural world as an unoxidised ore. It was known to the Greeks and Romans as 'cuprum' or 'cyprium', a reference to Cyprus, one of the largest copper mines in the ancient world. During the early Middle Ages, open-pit mining was the primary form of obtaining copper and other metals, where great chunks of the earth are gouged out into descending steps, from which the ores are extracted. Hydropower was also used to reveal ores through a process known as 'hushing', where controlled surges of water are used to wash away sediment and rock, revealing the precious minerals and ores underneath.	true

resources_long_description_res_vik_cloth	Weaving is one of the oldest attested crafts in the world and, by antiquity, had permeated every level of society. In its most basic form, slaves and children manufactured cheap, functional cloth, but at the highest level it was practiced by noblewomen who produced rich tapestries and fabrics as a conspicuous display of wealth. The importance of weaving makes it one of the few crafts to hold a prominent place in the mythological world. Many cultures contain goddesses, like the Greek Fates, who spin and cut the threads of mortal existence, and this idea may have its roots in the tapestry weaver’s ability to conjure a scene into life at the loom. 	true

resources_long_description_res_vik_wood	Wood has been a vital resource for as long as people could cut trees down. Wood was the both fuel and a material for construction, transport, warfare, furniture making and even the arts. Timber framing as a technique for constructing large buildings started in Rome and other cultures used wooden roofing. The early design of mortice-and-tenon joint was found in Egyptian furniture from 2500BC and its use spread throughout Europe and the Middle East. Although stone was used in many advanced cultures for construction, wood remained the basic building material for many peoples. And there was nothing else but wood if a people wanted to go to sea. Boat- and ship-building developed throughout the ages and secure timber supplies were crucial to establishing a navy. Egypt in particular fought many campaigns to secure good supplies of ship-worthy timber.	true

resources_long_description_res_vik_gold	Gold has attracted and fascinated humans since it was first found as a deposit in mountain rivers. As a malleable metal it can be made into virtually anything decorative from jewellery to armour plating, yet its softness makes it useless for tools or weaponry. It is also relatively simple to extract gold from rock as it is pure and easily distinguishable. Initially Rome and Greece had only small deposits but through their conquests gained access to greater supplies. Slaves would toil over six hundred feet below ground in mines that were exploited until they collapsed. The Greeks prized gold so highly that they attempted to turn base metals into gold, an ‘art’ known as alchemy.	true
resources_long_description_res_vik_salt	Salt was a valuable commodity that many barbarian tribes traded with the 'civilised' world. Archaeologists are able to identify areas of high salt production by the presence of a refuse deposit known as briquetage. Ancient salt production started with pottery vessels; brine was added to these and allowed to dry out and form salt cakes. These pots were then smashed to release the salt cake, resulting in large quantities of pottery shards or 'briquetage'. A recent discovery at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site, next to a salt spring in Lunca, Romania, suggest that the Neolithic inhabitants of the area were boiling the salt-laden spring water to extract the salt as far back as 6050BC, making it the oldest known salt works in the world.	true
resources_long_description_res_vik_lead	Lead has been used for thousands of years in all sorts of ways as it is easy to smelt, and easy to work either by casting or hammering into shape. The Romans were great users of lead, with some estimates going as high as 80,000 tonnes per year. Lead was extracted from galena ore that was a by-product of mining for silver. The Romans used this lead, or plumbum, to line baths and make their water pipes, and this use for water pipes gave English the word 'plumber', literally a worker in lead. The Romans and Greeks also produced lead coins and used it in construction. Some boxing gladiators used lead as knuckle covers. The Egyptians used lead to glaze pottery while the Babylonians and Assyrians used lead sheets in buildings. However, lead is a rather toxic material, and some even believe lead pollution contributed to the downfall of the Roman Empire. Roman atmospheric lead pollution can be measured today in ancient ice core samples.	true

He described a people who, if the situation required it, would rush from their ploughs without hesitation to pick up weapons as quickly as the courtier from court. Their rough and hilly terrain resulted in earlier traditions of Celtic culture being reflected in more military terms – for example, a heavily armoured combatant such as a feudal horseman would have difficulty operating there, so Welsh warriors relied more on agility in war situations, rather than brute strength. Where rival armies who fought them relied on stubborn resistance, the Welsh relied on constant movement.\\n\\nIn broad terms, the organisation of Welsh troops was arranged between those in the essential household force known as the ‘teulu’, and the individuals of the expanded common army, the ‘llu’. Avoiding the open plains where they were at a disadvantage against heavier cavalry, they sometimes operated on horseback in a similar style to early Roman skirmishers. Unarmoured horsemen would ride without stirrups or a saddle on a smaller, more agile mare, equipped with up to three throwing spears, ready to hurl while mounted. These tactics were honed from the prevalence of hit-and-run cattle-raiding, since the main causes of conflict in Gael-dominated areas was loot. Although their techniques were primitive for the era, Gaelic warriors were still able to conquer large parts of Caledonia with the help of their skirmishing cavalry tactics.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_est_champions_long	In the centuries following the 8th century appearance of the first recorded Viking raiders in the Irish Sea, those of the Norse who chose to settle in the region came to be known as the ‘Ostmenn’, or more literally, ‘the men of the east’. This was how the settled Norse-Gaels contrasted themselves from the native Gaels, who they referred to as ‘Vestmen’, unsurprisingly, the 'men of the west’. Combining local traditions with their own, the Norse-Gaels were culturally distinct from both the Gaels and their Scandinavian forefathers. Their hybridisation of traditions took place against the setting of their coastal defensive strongholds, many of which were the nuclei of the powerful independent kingdoms of later years. Norse-Gaelic powerbases would eventually be established in places like Dublin, Galloway, and Mann, amongst other places.\\n\\nAs with many facets of their culture, the martial traditions of the Norse-Gaels retained both Viking and Gaelic elements. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_earls_spearmen_long	As the kingdoms of Britain expanded, royal deputies were needed to deal with the routine business of the land on behalf of their kings. Such men were referred to as ealdormen in the early Saxon period, but by the 11th century the title was superseded by Scandinavian influence and they came to be referred to as earls and jarls, with the latter term used more in places more populated by Danes. An earl or jarl was not necessarily just a royal official, but could also be an upper-class man with land, estates, and a military retinue, likely by virtue of being descendant of a family that had previously ruled as kings, but subsequently had their lands absorbed into a larger kingdom.\\n\\nBeing well-to-do men, earls could fund the training and equipment for their own bands, so they were often made up of more elite soldiers than those who merely fought in the fyrds.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_nor_hirdmen_long	The Normans were one of the most successful and long-lived political and military cultures ever founded by the Vikings. Through military prowess and political manoeuvring in the 9th century, the Danish war leader Hrolf managed to secure a roughly autonomous region for his raiding army within the Frankish kingdom. Later going by the Frankish name Rollo, the Dane was given the status of duke, a position carried down his bloodline that ruled Normandy and subsequently conquered Norman lands. Their legendary expansionist successes were the result of a unique military structure within their fiefdoms, organised around a new type of warrior elite – the feudal knights. Supported by infantry, heavily armoured mounted lords would form fearsome cavalry blocks of around thirty men charging knee-to-knee, a psychologically imposing sight that often caused battle lines to break at their mere advance.\\n\\nUsing their system of infantry-supported knights, the Normans were incredibly effective in battle. Much like the Roman ‘comes’, in the Viking world there emerged a culture of heroic champions flanked by chosen companions. The ‘hirdman’ was the highest rank amongst such warriors, and in later times the rank carried with it a seat on the king’s council, enabling them to advise their rulers on non-military aspects of government. In Old Norse and Old English, the term translates to ‘household man’, originally referring to an armed retinue for a warlord but eventually morphing into ‘housecarl’ or ‘huscarl’, specifically referring to a royal guard. Following the ninth-century Danish settlement of England, huscarls also became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies, famously defeating their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and protecting King Harold's body to the very last man at Hastings.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_jav_cav_long	The Middle Irish word ‘ceithern’, pronounced ‘kern’, refers to a group of fighters who were one of two essential components of medieval Irish armies, the other being gallowglasses. Often found fighting as light infantry and occasionally light cavalry, the role of a kern was to provide skirmishing support to their heavy infantry counterparts. However, the training afforded them and the eventual roles they filled very much depended on the needs of their clan, which did not exclude them from the cut and thrust of melee warfare. Kerns would frequently be the first or last to launch attacks – their mobility meant that they were well-suited to initiate swift ambushes, after which they would melt back behind the gallowglasses, while later in battles they could also easily run down any fleeing routers.\\n\\nOn the battlefield, kerns wore a light leather coat which ensured unrestricted movement and agility. Avoiding the open plains where they were at a disadvantage against heavier cavalry, they sometimes operated on horseback in a similar style to early Roman skirmishers. Unarmoured horsemen would ride without stirrups or a saddle on a smaller, more agile mare, equipped with up to three throwing spears, ready to hurl while mounted.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_dan_mailed_swordsmen_long	The warriors of the Danelaw were part of the powerful Danish military aristocracy that dominated the areas of Britain in which the Vikings settled during the 9th century. There had been several confrontations between the fyrds of King Alfred the Great and Danish forces up until then, culminating in the agreement which saw the Danish warlord Guthrum withdraw his forces from Wessex in the autumn of AD 877. In doing so, a portion of his Great Heathen Army settled down in the eastern part of Mercia, laying the origins of the Danelaw, the region where distinctively Danish laws held prominence in the local courts. Legal traditions aside, Danish military customs were also well entrenched in the area as Guthrum, initially unsatisfied with his army’s unfulfillments, remained poised for potential renewed attacks on Wessex.\\n\\nThe settled Danes shared out the land for the purposes of agricultural subsistence, but still retained their strong Scandinavian warrior traditions. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour. The dominant types of swords in northwestern Europe were the broad-bladed two-edged forms that were up to ninety centimetres long.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_catapult_long	The onset of the Dark Ages saw the glory days of Greco-Roman-era siege engines come to an abrupt end. The catapult, named after the Greek word ‘katapultos’ meaning ‘shield piercer’, was one such siege weapon used to great effect by groups in antiquity. Having been so successful for the Roman Empire, numerous European war leaders of the early medieval period attempted to imitate the technology of one genus of Roman catapults called onagers. They originally took the form of large, torsion-powered missile throwers made entirely of wood, sat upon a kind of chassis supporting an ‘arm’ with a sling attached to it. Rotational forces would be harnessed into strands of thick, sinewy, coiled rope using a winch and ratchet, then the throwing arm was pulled back using a windlass and considerable brute strength, which was then secured in place as close to ground level as possible with a slip hook. The cocked arm held an incredible amount of potential energy and could be loaded with a payload – usually large rocks – waiting to be released and launched over vast distances.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the high-maintenance catapults of the early Middle Ages were troublesome machines and far inferior to those seen in antiquity, with the revived technology not able to match the strength, resilience, or accuracy of the onagers of the distant past. In time, however, medieval siege techniques eventually surpassed their forebears with the development of the 12th century European trebuchet, using technology thought to be similar to that used in China over a millennium earlier.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_ceorl_spearmen_long	An individual known as a ‘ceorl’ or ‘churl’ had a very particular place in the stratified society of Anglo-Saxon England. Forming the basis of the free populace, they were neither noblemen nor slaves, ranking above the servile classes but below the nobility. A ceorl’s free status was marked by several factors, such as his attendance at local courts, his payment of dues directly to his lord or king, and perhaps most notably for the era, his right to bear arms. In fact, since many ceorls would have been tenants or even landowners, under Anglo-Saxon law they would have been liable for military duty in the fyrd, as was the case in Wessex.\\n\\nBeing freemen, ceorls would have had to provide their own weaponry. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_airig_horsemen_long	The Irish kings of the Dark Ages were rulers of men rather than territory, which provided the basis for the development of Ireland’s tiered social order. At the top stood a High King who most regional rulers answered to, while at the bottom languished a large, unfree peasantry. Many Irish records of the early medieval period mention the word ‘aire’ to refer to those in between; a catch-all term describing anyone who held an independent legal status. Written laws dating to later centuries, however, use the word ‘airig’ more specifically in references to nobles or chiefs, distinguishing them from commoners. Indeed, Ireland’s sumptuary laws of the 7th and 8th centuries even refer to the colours that each social class were allowed to wear, including those for the Airig nobility – grey, brown, or red.\\n\\nCommanding a ‘cet’ – a military unit of up to one hundred men – the Airig nobility were high-ranking combatants. Their use of spears from horseback had been seen in a similar form around Britain before, with the Roman use of lance-bearing cavalry regiments. Advancements in horse training techniques and more significantly, the adoption of the stirrup into Western Europe, meant that horses were no longer primarily just a means to get to the battlefield. Mounted warriors previously ran a considerable risk of being unhorsed by the slightest impacts, nor could they carry out any significant blows without becoming unbalanced and vulnerable. Stirrups ensured stability, so what had formerly been impossible on horseback in the cut and thrust of battle then became easy.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_schiltron_long	A schiltron was a defensive pike formation used to great effect by Scottish foot soldiers against heavy cavalry in several encounters throughout medieval history. It is thought that the term itself dates back to the 10th century from the Old English word ‘scildtruma’ meaning a type of mobile phalanx or testudo. It was very similar in nature to both, consisting of long, heavy spears held at increasing angles by several rows of men, protected by wooden spikes embedded in the ground at the front of the line. With well-drilled movements, the schiltron was a fairly mobile entity that could quickly deploy in a splayed array which only the foolhardiest of horsemen would dare charge – indeed, most horses would downright refuse to go near it.\\n\\nSchiltron tactics were likely used for centuries from early medieval times, but a refinement of strategies led to historians deeming it notable enough to be mentioned as having been used in the Battle of Falkirk against the English at the end of the thirteenth century, albeit unsuccessfully. More notably, when the Scots faced the English once again a few years later in the Battle of Bannockburn, the vastly greater numbers of the English bolstered with heavy cavalry were gloriously defeated at the ends of Scottish pikes. Although early versions of the pikes used in schiltrons may have simply been long cylinders of wood carved into a point, later versions were much more sturdy, with pointed iron crossheads pinned onto a shaft of hardwood, cut in lengths of up to fifteen feet.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_caterans_long	The name ‘cateran’ comes from the Gaelic word ‘ceathairne’, used to refer to a band of armed peasants from the Scottish Highlands. Literally, the word means ‘battle man’ – a warrior. Specifically employed by a warlord as a private fighting force to harass neighbouring clans, over time the cateran became professional soldiers, rather than simply low-born men pressed into the service of their local lord on a part-time basis. By the beginning of the Middle Ages the word cateran had fallen out of use, only being used to describe bandits, marauders and cattle-thieves at that point in time. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools. Various adaptations of axes were used in battle, such as the smaller throwing francisca made famous by the Franks, and the slightly larger versions primarily used as part of axe-and-shield war getups. Axes granted a unique form of damage output – although swords were ideal for slashing and stabbing, an axe could hack and chop with relatively less effort, and in the right hands was particularly useful for piercing armour, decapitation, and dismemberment.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_javelins_long	For many, the word ‘Viking’ conjures up scenes of pillaging marauders from across the sea, rampaging around the coastlines of Britain in the last centuries leading up to the Norman conquest. However, the Vikings should not simply be thought of as mindless, bloodthirsty looters, and instead should be seen for what they really were – initially, sea-based raiders from Scandinavia who would avoid a fight if it meant a quick profit, and later on, migrants in search of newer pastures to settle in, from which they could subsist and even trade. Indeed, the earliest Viking forays into Britain were quick raids of lightly defended, but highly bountiful targets such as churches and monasteries, while in later years they concentrated their actions on conquering lands to establish themselves as permanent kings.\\n\\nThe Vikings were rightly known for their skill at war, utilising the traditional barbarian charge alongside carefully drilled shield wall tactics.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_dan_anglian_champions_long	From the earliest times of the Danelaw, a number of fortified Saxon towns known as burhs were assigned their own Danish armies, where the most learned warriors practised martial traditions that were both Saxon and Dane. By the time of the beginnings of Danish rule in England, it had been 450 years since the initial Anglian settlement in the east, during which the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia was formed. The Northmen had attacked the region several times, but from around AD 870 following the defeat and martyring of King Edmund, they overran the entire East Anglian kingdom with the intention to stay permanently. With this large-scale settlement there was much synthesis between the traditions and customs of the Vikings and that of the Saxons, which, to some extent, were already culturally similar. As a testament to this, Danish huscarls became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies, famously defeating their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and protecting King Harold's body to the very last man at Hastings. Undoubtedly such dedication was born out of a tradition of champions that were initially uniquely East Anglian, or more broadly, ‘Danish-Saxon’.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_thegn_spearmen_long	During the era of Viking settlement in Britain, an integral part of the fyrds was a class of noblemen-warriors who owned land granted from lords or kings by right of a provided military service. They were known as thegns, who in the earliest times of Saxon migration were exclusively defined by that military service. The first Anglo-Saxon leaders kept ‘gesiths’ as they were formerly known in their retinues, who were better trained and more highly motivated due to a close relationship with their warmongering lords. By the later Saxon era, they had developed into a middle-ranking land-owning ‘officer class’ with major roles in organising and leading the fyrds. Danish rule over conquered English lands meant that some thegns fought for their conquerors in return for being able to keep their lands within the puppet kingdoms.\\n\\nThegns were much better equipped for war than most other troops. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_raider_swordsmen_long	Surviving on the edge of the Roman world for centuries, early medieval Ireland was a militarily primitive place, with archaeological evidence showing that Irish war equipment was inferior to that of other Europeans. Being a people of martial character, the Irish nevertheless engaged in warfare and raids more as an aristocratic pastime than a matter of survival. Raiding between the various groups within Ireland for the purposes of loot was commonplace and frequently the reason to take up arms, with the theft of cattle often the cause of bigger conflicts. The Irish were also known to have been raiding western Britain prior to the end of Roman rule, long before the Vikings had even been seen there, with slaves being the most lucrative form of booty.\\n\\nThe swiftness of Irish raiders was their greatest strength, with most fighting as unarmoured infantry wielding older, more traditional weapons.

Most included a pommel on the hilt to keep the sword from slipping out of the hand when used from horseback, and also handy to dish out blunt-force trauma when the situation required it.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_earls_horsemen_long	As the kingdoms of Britain expanded, royal deputies were needed to deal with the routine business of the land on behalf of their kings. Such men were referred to as ealdormen in the early Saxon period, but by the 11th century the title was superseded by Scandinavian influence and they came to be referred to as earls and jarls, with the latter term used more in places more populated by Danes. An earl or jarl was not necessarily just a royal official, but could also be an upper-class man with land, estates, and a military retinue, likely by virtue of being descendant of a family that had previously ruled as kings, but subsequently had their lands absorbed into a larger kingdom.\\n\\nBeing well-to-do men, earls could fund the training and equipment for their own bands, so they were often made up of more elite soldiers than those who merely fought in the fyrds.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_gen_royal_companion_bodyguard_long	In the years following the departure of the Romans from Britain, many communities had to organise their headship – at least in part – for the purposes of war. In many places, the constant threat of invasion or absorption by hostile expanding neighbours meant that the links between social organisation and martial organisation were close and integral, which was reflected in the hierarchy. Every social or family group had to look to their own security to defend their rights and interests, and it was no different for the ruling elite. The function of kings and chiefs was, above all, to provide war leadership. In many parts of Britain, leaders of tribal descent used loyalty systems which granted the best warriors the greatest rewards when in service of their households as companions or bodyguards, which extended onto the battlefield. A similar system existed in Celtic Ireland and Scotland, where martial leaders presided over small and ever-changing kingdoms alongside nobles and royal followers who fought in their direct service. The Welsh, although less influenced by feudalism, also operated under similar systems of the ‘teulu’ – the individual princes’ and chieftains’ personal bodyguards – who typically went to war alongside larger numbers of freemen who made up the bulk of the armies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_thegn_horsemen_long	During the era of Viking settlement in Britain, an integral part of the fyrds was a class of noblemen-warriors who owned land granted from lords or kings by right of a provided military service. They were known as thegns, who in the earliest times of Saxon migration were exclusively defined by that military service. The first Anglo-Saxon leaders kept ‘gesiths’ as they were formerly known in their retinues, who were better trained and more highly motivated due to a close relationship with their warmongering lords. By the later Saxon era, they had developed into a middle-ranking land-owning ‘officer class’ with major roles in organising and leading the fyrds. Danish rule over conquered English lands meant that some thegns fought for their conquerors in return for being able to keep their lands within the puppet kingdoms.\\n\\nThegns were much better equipped for war than most other troops.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_fyrd_javelinmen_long	The fyrd was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary individuals who were not tied to a lord as fighting vassals. The Saxons used fyrds throughout their period of dominance and even for the settled Danes, levying troops was a frequent necessity. After King Alfred of the West Saxons finally defeated Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, he famously implemented a defence-in-depth system of forts that also reformed the Saxon fyrds by dividing them into three main groups. One part of the force remained at home on their estates, while another stayed out on patrol in the field in a constant state of readiness. The third group were the men guarding their local forts, all of which culminated in Anglo-Saxon England becoming a very well-defended place indeed.\\n\\nWhen the men of the fyrd were called upon to fight, they were frequently doing so to protect their homes and livelihoods.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_marcher_spearmen_long	The border area between England and Wales has long been decisive in the course of British history. In early medieval England, a ‘marcher’ was a soldier appointed to guard the Welsh Marches, the name used to refer to the imprecise areas of demarcation between lands of Mercia and those of the Welsh kingdoms. Mercia often had a tumultuous relationship with its neighbours to the west, as attested by the construction of Offa’s Dyke during his reign in the latter half of the 9th century. Extending for just over 60 miles, the main purpose for the earthworks was to reinforce a frontier with the newly resurgent Welsh kingdom of Powys. The Dyke was likely to have seen frequent small-scale scuffles between the Mercian guards and unsavoury groups such as cattle rustlers and opportunistic raiding parties.\\n\\nThe marchers sent to guard Offa’s Dyke also had to be capable enough to repel attacks from bona fide warriors.

Later going by the Frankish name Rollo, the Dane was given the status of duke, a position carried down his bloodline that ruled Normandy and subsequently conquered Norman lands. Their legendary expansionist successes were the result of a unique military structure within their fiefdoms, organised around a new type of warrior elite – the feudal knights.

Referred to as the fianna, they were made up of individuals who had chosen the life as an alternative to languishing in the social limbo of not having received land of their own in the form of inheritance, endowment, or dowry, so had decided to prove their mettle in other ways. Often of aristocratic birth, they survived by camping, hunting, fishing, and foraging, but life in the wilderness was not always so straightforward. Members of the fianna were quickly hardened by the necessities of survival, sometimes raiding and pillaging nearby territories which were unaligned or hostile with their own tuath. To their own people, they were considered a ready source of mobile fighters that could quickly be called upon in the event of enemy raids or invasions.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_thegns_long	During the era of Viking settlement in Britain, an integral part of the fyrds was a class of noblemen-warriors who owned land granted from lords or kings by right of a provided military service. They were known as thegns, who in the earliest times of Saxon migration were exclusively defined by that military service. The first Anglo-Saxon leaders kept ‘gesiths’ as they were formerly known in their retinues, who were better trained and more highly motivated due to a close relationship with their warmongering lords. By the later Saxon era, they had developed into a middle-ranking land-owning ‘officer class’ with major roles in organising and leading the fyrds. Danish rule over conquered English lands meant that some thegns fought for their conquerors in return for being able to keep their lands within the puppet kingdoms.\\n\\nThegns were much better equipped for war than most other troops. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour. The dominant types of swords in northwestern Europe were the broad-bladed two-edged forms that were up to ninety centimetres long. Most included a pommel on the hilt to keep the sword from slipping out of the hand when used from horseback, and also handy to dish out blunt-force trauma when the situation required it.	true

Ancestors of the modern Irish Wolf Hound, they were truly giant dogs allegedly capable of ripping a man's head off, and even dragging him right off his horse or chariot to maul him to death. It is thought that the modern name ‘Wolf Hound’ was not given to them by virtue of their similarities in appearance to wolves – although they may have had similar coloured coats to grey wolves, and easily matched them in stature – but rather for their effective use in hunting and killing them, such was their power and size. The Celts’ war dogs were even mentioned by Julius Caesar in his treatise ‘The Gallic Wars’, with the Romans referring to them as ‘canes Scots’, differentiating them from the ancient Rottweiler-like molossus used by the Greeks and Romans in battle. They also heavily feature in Irish mythology and were revered on the island, appearing on the coat of arms of several early Irish Kings, and known to have typically been owned by nobility for guarding property and herds as well as for war.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_dane_axes_long	For many, the word ‘Viking’ conjures up scenes of pillaging marauders from across the sea, rampaging around the coastlines of Britain in the last centuries leading up to the Norman conquest. However, the Vikings should not simply be thought of as mindless, bloodthirsty looters, and instead should be seen for what they really were – initially, sea-based raiders from Scandinavia who would avoid a fight if it meant a quick profit, and later on, migrants in search of newer pastures to settle in, from which they could subsist and even trade. Indeed, the earliest Viking forays into Britain were quick raids of lightly defended, but highly bountiful targets such as churches and monasteries, while in later years they concentrated their actions on conquering lands to establish themselves as permanent kings.\\n\\nThe Vikings were rightly known for their skill at war, utilising the traditional barbarian charge alongside carefully drilled shield wall tactics.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_cha_transport	For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where ships could go. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_wel_valley_spearmen_long	In modern times, references to ‘The Valleys’ of Wales are mostly associated with the industrialised regions in the south of the country, but in historical accounts dating back to the early Middle Ages, the ‘Valley Spearmen’ of Wales refers to a tradition of Welsh warriors which originated in the north. All infantry of medieval Welsh armies were known for their agility and aptitude in operating in the rough and hilly terrain of their homelands, and while the men of the south were renowned for their prowess with the Welsh longbow, the regions around the historical northern county of Merionethshire were known for their tough spearmen. Often dressed in red linen shirts and long woollen cloaks, they were depicted as having worn only one shoe with one foot kept bare, likely as a way to keep their balance in their hilly landscape. They were particularly effective on marshy or broken ground, which always favoured them against heavy cavalry or heavily-armoured infantry. The lightly-armoured Welsh spearmen were well-drilled in the use of phalanxes and long pikes, but as much as their agility in their own landscape was a considerable advantage, without it they were often at risk of being overrun by better-equipped opposition, as was the case during their crushing 13th century defeats at the hands of the English under Edward I.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_mormaer_horsemen_long	The regional lords of early medieval Scotland known as the ‘Mormaers’ were awarded the title as individuals positioned directly beneath the king within the structure of Highland society. Initially they were the rulers of any one of the seven provinces which made up the area of Celtic Scotland north of the Forth and Clyde, but eventually became the group of nobles who oversaw the defence of the Scottish coast from the Nordic raids which occurred after the Picts had been supplanted as the largest tribal group in north Britannia. Although the title is Celtic in origin, later Viking influence rendered it ‘Jarl’ and eventually under Anglo-Norman influence, ‘Earl’.\\n\\nLike many other nobles of the period, the Mormaers fought as cavalry on the battlefield. Their use of spears from horseback had been seen in a similar form around Britain before, with the Roman use of lance-bearing cavalry regiments. Advancements in horse training techniques and more significantly, the adoption of the stirrup into Western Europe, meant that horses were no longer primarily just a means to get to the battlefield. Mounted warriors previously ran a considerable risk of being unhorsed by the slightest impacts, nor could they carry out any significant blows without becoming unbalanced and vulnerable. Stirrups ensured stability, so that what had formerly been impossible on horseback in the cut and thrust of battle then became easy.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_hus_dane_axes_long	Much like the Roman ‘comes’, in the Viking world there emerged a culture of heroic champions flanked by chosen companions. The ‘hirdman’ was the highest rank amongst such warriors, and in later times the rank carried with it a seat on the king’s council, enabling them to advise their rulers on non-military aspects of government. In Old Norse and Old English, the term translates to ‘household man’, originally referring to an armed retinue for a warlord but eventually morphing into ‘housecarl’ or ‘huscarl’, specifically referring to a royal guard. Following the 9th century Danish settlement of England, huscarls also became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies, famously defeating their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and protecting King Harold's body to the very last man at Hastings.\\n\\nHirdmen and huscarls were undoubtedly warriors of elite status, reflected in their superior weaponry and armour.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_fyrd_spearmen_long	The fyrd was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary individuals who were not tied to a lord as fighting vassals. The Saxons used fyrds throughout their period of dominance and even for the settled Danes, levying troops was a frequent necessity. After King Alfred of the West Saxons finally defeated Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, he famously implemented a defence-in-depth system of forts that also reformed the Saxon fyrds by dividing them into three main groups. One part of the force remained at home on their estates, while another stayed out on patrol in the field in a constant state of readiness. The third group were the men guarding their local forts, all of which culminated in Anglo-Saxon England becoming a very well-defended place indeed.\\n\\nWhen the men of the fyrd were called upon to fight, they were frequently doing so to protect their homes and livelihoods.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_berserkers_long	Howling like animals at their enemies across the battlefield, the Berserkers of Viking armies often took on the semblance of wild animals, entering battles in an almost trance-like state. They would work themselves into a frenzy so intense, it is said they bit on the edges of their shields and could even ignore the pain of wounds. Their apparently feral appearance is alluded to in the Old Norse etymology of their name – ‘ber’ meaning bear, and ‘serkr’ roughly translating to shirt, thus literally, ‘a bear-skinned warrior’. Indeed, they had little protection other than the skins they wore, and were utterly convinced of their invulnerability against fire, blade, or any blow that came their way. The roots of this mentality came from the old Norse religions, in which many warriors clung to the belief that Odin, the God of War, gave them both protection and superhuman powers, so that they would have no need of armour. To encounter these enraged warriors on the battlefield was to face crazed men who were defying the standard logistics of battle at the time – it is no wonder that some who did so and lived to tell the tale thought them to be shape-shifters that actually became the animals whose skins they wore. Other, more rational views suggested that they were simply carried along by a wave of group euphoria.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_freemen_axes_long	The freemen living within the social orders of the early medieval period generally existed as a group between the nobles above them and the slave classes below. Freemen possessed the most social mobility of all classes – for example, they could accumulate followers as a result of battle exploits, or even more simply from their generosity or camaraderie with others. Accumulation of wealth earned by amassing battle loot or simply through success in a trade was also possible, but in any case, accumulating enough of either followers or riches could elevate a freeman into nobility. Equally, accumulation of debts that couldn't be repaid would mean a freeman could easily become a bondsman, working as a slave to pay off his debt or even fighting as a serf levy for another man until his debt was considered no more.\\n\\nAbove all, freemen were free to fight. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools. Various adaptations of axes were used in battle, such as the smaller throwing francisca made famous by the Franks, and the slightly larger versions primarily used as part of axe-and-shield war getups.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_wood_kerns_long	Existing on the fringes of Roman-ruled Britain, early medieval Ireland was by no means a lawless place. However, native Gaels who by some sequence of events ended up landless and not tied to a lord – particularly those with an aptitude for fighting – sometimes ended up living as outlaws in the mountains and woods. Such combatants were known as ‘widcairns’ or wood kerns, and were feared and hated by sedentary peoples in equal measure. Using their terrain and knowledge of swift ambush tactics, they were formidable fighters who took what they needed from those unfortunate enough to venture into their woodland territories. They operated under the leadership of fiery spirits among the youthful gentry and former nobility of Ireland, pushed to the edges of society with resentments and bravado that made them Robin Hood figures to their followers.\\n\\nWith no lands of their own, wood kerns fought and lived solely for plunder. The throwing spear or javelin was one such genus of weapons they used, with the thrusting variety not always entirely distinct from the thrown variety. The advantage of the javelin thrower was the ability to potentially pierce through shields and armour from distance, but this was offset by the reduced range and limited output compared to standard archers, since there were only so many javelins a thrower could carry at any one time.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_axe_hersir_long	When the Vikings first set out to pillage the coasts of Europe in the 8th century, those who led the raiding parties were not kings, earls, or jarls, but a lesser rank of war leaders known as hersirs. They were superior warriors who commanded small bands of men, organising them into the shield walls used to defeat the armies that opposed their early incursions into places like Britain. In the Norse context, a hersir was typically an independent landowner or chieftain, but by the tenth century their role had changed into something much less autonomous with many becoming regional military servants of Scandinavian kings and nobles. Many also still gave their military services to earls and jarls as battlefield companions, making them the rough equivalent to the huscarls of the late Anglo-Saxon period.\\n\\nBeing military commanders, hersirs typically donned superior equipment to the men they led on their raids. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools. Various adaptations of axes were used in battle, such as the smaller throwing francisca made famous by the Franks, and the slightly larger versions primarily used as part of axe-and-shield war getups. Axes granted a unique form of damage output – although swords were ideal for slashing and stabbing, an axe could hack and chop with relatively less effort, and in the right hands was particularly useful for piercing armour, decapitation, and dismemberment.	true

In doing so, a portion of his Great Heathen Army settled down in the eastern part of Mercia, laying the origins of the Danelaw, the region where distinctively Danish laws held prominence in the local courts.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_highland_bows_long	The early medieval Highlanders of Alba were a cultural mix of Gaelic, Celtic, and other peoples, who had much in common with similar groups in nearby Ireland and northern Britain. Centuries of encounters with invading Romans and the sporadic infighting that followed meant that militarily, they were well-prepared. Organised under local commanders and lords, most males were expected to be ready to fight, but when they were not being called upon to defend their land or clan they farmed and fished alongside their women. Their climate made them particularly tough, readily fighting into the depth of winter when required. Even the Vikings were fearful of the Highlanders of northern Britain by their own accounts – the classic Icelandic saga ‘Islendingasagur’ warns other Norsemen to approach parts of the Scottish coast with caution, lest it cost them their lives!\\n\\nThe warriors of Alba were generally made up of territorial units of fighting men. Although archery wasn't considered the most ‘warrior-like’ of practices, it was still a specialisation chosen by some for the purposes of war. The prevalence of hunting and the past presence of stationed Roman archers around Britain meant that it was by no means an unknown discipline, with archer regiment tactics varying between the warring groups of the day.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_freemen_javelinmen_long	The freemen living within the social orders of the early medieval period generally existed as a group between the nobles above them and the slave classes below. Freemen possessed the most social mobility of all classes – for example, they could accumulate followers as a result of battle exploits, or even more simply from their generosity or camaraderie with others. Accumulation of wealth earned by amassing battle loot or simply through success in a trade was also possible, but in any case, accumulating enough of either followers or riches could elevate a freeman into nobility. Equally, accumulation of debts that couldn't be repaid would mean a freeman could easily become a bondsman, working as a slave to pay off his debt or even fighting as a serf levy for another man until his debt was considered no more.\\n\\nAbove all, freemen were free to fight. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence. Given its comparative cheapness and ease of construction, the spear was one of the most commonly used weapons among all classes of fighting men before and throughout medieval times. Its notable advantage was the longer reach it afforded its bearer, enabling effective engagement with a larger or mounted enemy who might otherwise be out of reach. The Viking tendency to emblazon spears with ostentatious decorative carvings indicates that some were primarily used for thrusting rather than throwing, reducing the possibility of losing what were obviously prized weapons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_kern_axemen_long	The Middle Irish word ‘ceithern’, pronounced ‘kern’, refers to a group of fighters who were one of two essential components of medieval Irish armies, the other being gallowglasses. Often found fighting as light infantry and occasionally light cavalry, the role of a kern was to provide skirmishing support to their heavy infantry counterparts. However, the training afforded them and the eventual roles they filled very much depended on the needs of their clan, which did not exclude them from the cut and thrust of melee warfare. Kerns would frequently be the first or last to launch attacks – their mobility meant that they were well-suited to initiate swift ambushes, after which they would melt back behind the gallowglasses, while later in battles they could also easily run down any fleeing routers.\\n\\nOn the battlefield, kerns wore a light leather coat which ensured unrestricted movement and agility. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_seaxs_long	The Saxons were not only warriors by nature, but also by name. The term ‘Saxon’ was thought to have been used by the Romans to describe the West Germanic tribe from which the Anglo-Saxons descended – the ‘Seaxe’ in Old English, also simply meaning ‘knife’. By extension, Saxon quite literally means ‘warrior with knives’. In practical terms, the seax was a sidearm that could be used as a domestic tool or as a backup to a main weapon, but there were certainly those who used them as a central means of self-defence. The use of supplementary dagger-type weapons was not limited to the Saxons, with Scandinavian groups of the 4th and 5th centuries carrying similar single-edged knives, and even the smaller Hunnic sabre was thought to be an ancestor of the weapon. Even so, the seax was widespread enough amongst the Saxons in particular for the term to be used by others to differentiate them from other tribes. To the Saxons themselves, the seax likely had symbolic connotations relating to a person’s status. For example, carrying one may have marked out an individual as a hunter, or perhaps even signified the broader group of all Saxon freemen, since slaves were not allowed to bear arms.	true

He described a people who, if the situation required it, would rush from their ploughs without hesitation to pick up weapons as quickly as the courtier from court. Their rough and hilly terrain resulted in earlier traditions of Celtic culture being reflected in more military terms – for example, a heavily armoured combatant such as a feudal horseman would have difficulty operating there, so Welsh warriors relied more on agility in war situations, rather than brute strength. Where rival armies who fought them relied on stubborn resistance, the Welsh relied on constant movement.\\n\\nIn broad terms, the organisation of Welsh troops was arranged between those in the essential household force known as the ‘teulu’, and the individuals of the expanded common army, the ‘llu’.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_wel_bows_long	Long before the prominence of archers as staple regiments in the English army during the Hundred Years' War, there had already been an extensive tradition of archery in Wales. The historical record relates that in AD 633, five centuries before its earliest known use by the English, a Welsh longbow was used to kill Prince Edwin of Northumbria in a confrontation with the army of King Cadwallon of Gwined. Early Welsh bows were constructed from wych elm, as opposed to yew or horn used in the English adaptations which came later, and designed not for distance but to inflict severe wounds in close quarters. This was suited to a landscape in which the main fighting tactic was a quick charge followed by a feigned retreat into the woods, with the intention being to trap pursuers in a lethal short-range ambush.\\n\\nWelsh longbows required considerable training to operate, but were far more powerful than any other ranged weapons of the era. As the historian Gerald of Wales put it, their arrows could penetrate ‘a hand’s width into an oak door’, ‘through a man’s armour and thigh, into his horse’, and ‘through an armoured horseman’s hip into his saddle’. The aptitude of the Welsh archers in ranged warfare was also reflected by the obvious difficulty in mastering the later longbows they became known for. They were highly unwieldy weapons, bulky but capable of a draw-weight exceeding 50 kg. In fact, archaeological finds of skeletons belonging to longbow archers almost always show recognisable deformations, with enlarged arms and bone spurs commonly seen on the wrists, shoulders, and fingers.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_fyrd_archers_long	The fyrd was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary individuals who were not tied to a lord as fighting vassals. The Saxons used fyrds throughout their period of dominance and even for the settled Danes, levying troops was a frequent necessity. After King Alfred of the West Saxons finally defeated Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, he famously implemented a defence-in-depth system of forts that also reformed the Saxon fyrds by dividing them into three main groups. One part of the force remained at home on their estates, while another stayed out on patrol in the field in a constant state of readiness. The third group were the men guarding their local forts, all of which culminated in Anglo-Saxon England becoming a very well-defended place indeed.\\n\\nWhen the men of the fyrd were called upon to fight, they were frequently doing so to protect their homes and livelihoods. Although archery wasn't considered the most ‘warrior-like’ of practices, it was still a specialisation chosen by some for the purposes of war.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_dan_northumbrian_thegns_long	The cultural synthesis between Vikings and Saxons that took place in locations like Northumbria affected several facets of Anglo-Saxon life, not least their military practices. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle remarks that in AD 876 the Danish war leader Halfdan led his retinue of warriors away from the Great Army and returned to Northumbria, where it is recorded that he then divided up the land there so that his people could ‘plough and support themselves’. Indeed, the eventual Viking settlement of northern England soon saw one particularly integral part of Anglo-Saxon army traditions adopted by the newly settled Vikings – the recognition of the thegns, a class of noblemen-warriors who had owned land granted from lords or kings by right of a provided military service. In the earliest times of Saxon migration, the thegns were exclusively defined by that military service, with the first Anglo-Saxon leaders keeping ‘gesiths’ as they were formerly known in their retinues, who were better trained and more highly motivated due to a close relationship with their warmongering lords. By the later Saxon era, however, they had developed into a middle-ranking land-owning ‘officer class’ to Saxon kings, with major roles in organising and leading the fyrds. Danish rule over conquered English lands meant that some Saxon thegns fought for their conquerors, in return for being able to keep their lands within the puppet kingdoms.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_earls_thegns_long	As the kingdoms of Britain expanded, royal deputies were needed to deal with the routine business of the land on behalf of their kings. Such men were referred to as ealdormen in the early Saxon period, but by the 11th century the title was superseded by Scandinavian influence and they came to be referred to as earls and jarls, with the latter term used more in places more populated by Danes. An earl or jarl was not necessarily just a royal official, but could also be an upper-class man with land, estates, and a military retinue, likely by virtue of being descendant of a family that had previously ruled as kings, but subsequently had their lands absorbed into a larger kingdom.\\n\\nBeing well-to-do men, earls could fund the training and equipment for their own bands, so they were often made up of more elite soldiers than those who merely fought in the fyrds. Militarily, their thegns were their most important servants.

Being a people of martial character, the Irish nevertheless engaged in warfare and raids more as an aristocratic pastime than a matter of survival. Raiding between the various groups within Ireland for the purposes of loot was commonplace and frequently the reason to take up arms, with the theft of cattle often the cause of bigger conflicts. The Irish were also known to have been raiding western Britain prior to the end of Roman rule, long before the Vikings had even been seen there, with slaves being the most lucrative form of booty.\\n\\nThe swiftness of Irish raiders was their greatest strength, with most fighting as unarmoured infantry wielding older, more traditional weapons.

The systems which existed in Celtic Ireland and Scotland were ones in which martial leaders presided over small and ever-changing kingdoms alongside nobles and royal followers who fought in their direct service. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour. The dominant types of swords in north western Europe were the broad-bladed two-edged forms that were up to ninety centimetres long. Most included a pommel on the hilt to keep the sword from slipping out of the hand when used from horseback, and also handy to dish out blunt-force trauma when the situation required it.	true

Advancements in horse training techniques and more significantly, the adoption of the stirrup into Western Europe, meant that horses were no longer primarily just a means to get to the battlefield. Mounted warriors previously ran a considerable risk of being unhorsed by the slightest impacts, nor could they carry out any significant blows without becoming unbalanced and vulnerable.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_gen_warlords_hearthguard_long	A ‘hearthweru’ or hearthguard was, more often than not, a personal friend of a warlord or king who would readily offer his sword in protection on the battlefield in return for gifts, lands, and power. The image of a leader being a generous donor of valuables to his most loyal companions was a running theme throughout the early Middle Ages, and this was certainly the case for the raiding Vikings and the settled Norse kings in Britain and Ireland. In the Viking context, wealth in the form of loot would have certainly appealed to a young warrior of the hearthguard and was often the primary motivation to serve a great war leader, but so was the chance to stake a claim to newly settled lands. The acquisition of land or wealth was not always the sole factor that sustained a hearthguard’s relationship with a warlord or king, however. The very name 'hearth' friend or companion implies closeness to the man served, eating and sharing his company around the fire, through which great bonds of friendship and loyalty were made. When not at war, hearth companions were the closest thing to a loyal professional militia, dispensing their lord’s will and authority on his behalf.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_black_blades_long	The early medieval Highlanders of Alba were a cultural mix of Gaelic, Celtic, and other peoples, who had much in common with similar groups in nearby Ireland and northern Britain. Centuries of encounters with invading Romans and the sporadic infighting that followed meant that militarily, they were well-prepared. Organised under local commanders and lords, most males were expected to be ready to fight, but when they were not being called upon to defend their land or clan they farmed and fished alongside their women. Their climate made them particularly tough, readily fighting into the depth of winter when required. Even the Vikings were fearful of the Highlanders of northern Britain by their own accounts – the classic Icelandic saga ‘Islendingasagur’ warns other Norsemen to approach parts of the Scottish coast with caution, lest it cost them their lives!\\n\\nThe warriors of Alba were generally made up of territorial units of fighting men. Historical accounts indicate that when some of their forces fought, they often wielded weapons that were very dark in colour. This must have been particularly alien to foreign attackers, when even a second's hesitation on the battlefield could mean the difference between life and death. Tales from the time speak of warriors with black swords, indicating that blades may have been left unpolished to help with waterproofing against the British weather. This initially unforeseen effect on invaders was soon turned to an advantage by the wily Scots, who capitalised on their ferocious appearance, in combination with the element of surprise, to defeat their opponents.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_horse_boys_long	Surviving on the edge of the Roman world for centuries, early medieval Ireland was a militarily primitive place, with archaeological evidence showing that Irish war equipment was inferior to that of other Europeans. Being a people of martial character, the Irish nevertheless engaged in warfare and raids more as an aristocratic pastime than a matter of survival. Raiding between the various groups within Ireland for the purposes of loot was commonplace and frequently the reason to take up arms, with the theft of cattle often the cause of bigger conflicts. The Irish were also known to have been raiding western Britain prior to the end of Roman rule, long before the Vikings had even been seen there, with slaves being the most lucrative form of booty.\\n\\nThe swiftness of Irish raiders was their greatest strength, with most fighting as unarmoured infantry wielding older, more traditional weapons. Avoiding the open plains where they were at a disadvantage against heavier cavalry, they sometimes operated on horseback in a similar style to early Roman skirmishers. Unarmoured horsemen would ride without stirrups or a saddle on a smaller, more agile mare, equipped with up to three throwing spears, ready to hurl while mounted. These tactics were honed from the prevalence of hit-and-run cattle-raiding, since the main causes of conflict in Gael-dominated areas was loot. Although their techniques were primitive for the era, Gaelic warriors were still able to conquer large parts of Caledonia with the help of their skirmishing cavalry tactics.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_sword_hirdmen_long	Much like the Roman ‘comes’, in the Viking world there emerged a culture of heroic champions flanked by chosen companions. The ‘hirdman’ was the highest rank amongst such warriors, and in later times the rank carried with it a seat on the king’s council, enabling them to advise their rulers on non-military aspects of government. In Old Norse and Old English, the term translates to ‘household man’, originally referring to an armed retinue for a warlord but eventually morphing into ‘housecarl’ or ‘huscarl’, specifically referring to a royal guard. Following the 9th century Danish settlement of England, huscarls also became an integral part of Anglo-Saxon armies, famously defeating their Norwegian counterparts at Stamford Bridge and protecting King Harold's body to the very last man at Hastings.\\n\\nHirdmen and huscarls were undoubtedly warriors of elite status, reflected in their superior weaponry and armour. Many of them strove to master the broadsword, given its unique ability to maim and kill in the right hands. Sword fighting was generally practised by men of status who could afford the costly weapon, with blades commonly passed between generations as symbols of family honour. The dominant types of swords in northwestern Europe were the broad-bladed two-edged forms that were up to ninety centimetres long. Most included a pommel on the hilt to keep the sword from slipping out of the hand when used from horseback, and also handy to dish out blunt-force trauma when the situation required it.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_eng_fyrd_axemen_long	The fyrd was, in the simplest terms, a levy of ordinary individuals who were not tied to a lord as fighting vassals. The Saxons used fyrds throughout their period of dominance and even for the settled Danes, levying troops was a frequent necessity. After King Alfred of the West Saxons finally defeated Guthrum the Dane in AD 878, he famously implemented a defence-in-depth system of forts that also reformed the Saxon fyrds by dividing them into three main groups. One part of the force remained at home on their estates, while another stayed out on patrol in the field in a constant state of readiness. The third group were the men guarding their local forts, all of which culminated in Anglo-Saxon England becoming a very well-defended place indeed.\\n\\nWhen the men of the fyrd were called upon to fight, they were frequently doing so to protect their homes and livelihoods. For some, the one-handed axe would have been the weapon of choice, since swords were costly and axes would have been already widely available as domestic tools. Various adaptations of axes were used in battle, such as the smaller throwing francisca made famous by the Franks, and the slightly larger versions primarily used as part of axe-and-shield war getups. Axes granted a unique form of damage output – although swords were ideal for slashing and stabbing, an axe could hack and chop with relatively less effort, and in the right hands was particularly useful for piercing armour, decapitation, and dismemberment.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_crossbowmen_long	Thought to have been invented simultaneously in both Greece and China during the 5th century BC, various forms of crossbow had been spreading rapidly across Europe from well before the Migration Period. By the turn of millennium into the Common Era, the Romans had already fielded their large torsion-sprung scorpion and ballista bolt throwers for the first time, and by the second century were training cavalry to use handheld adaptations on the battlefield. Eventually, the crossbow reached the barbarian tribal confederations of northern and western Europe, where it was used in deadly combination with the pike tactics emerging at the time, while also becoming a popular hunting weapon.\\n\\nThe crossbow originally came about as a way of automating the simple bow. It worked by mounting a shorter arrow or bolt horizontally on a barrel or stock that, once fitted, could be drawn with a ratchet mechanism to a much greater tension than a man alone could generate without one. This meant that the crossbow could penetrate heavy armour far more effectively than ever before. Also, unlike the bow which took many years of training and practice to master, a layman could be taught to use a crossbow in well within a week. Comparably poor rates of fire was the weapon’s only real downside, but since it could be held in tension for a much longer period of time, crossbowmen often had time to pick and choose their shots carefully. This aspect meant that crossbows were unequalled as the sniper rifles of the ancient and medieval worlds.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_hersir_spears_long	When the Vikings first set out to pillage the coasts of Europe in the 8th century, those who led the raiding parties were not kings, earls, or jarls, but a lesser rank of war leaders known as hersirs. They were superior warriors who commanded small bands of men, organising them into the shield walls used to defeat the armies that opposed their early incursions into places like Britain. In the Norse context, a hersir was typically an independent landowner or chieftain, but by the tenth century their role had changed into something much less autonomous with many becoming regional military servants of Scandinavian kings and nobles. Many also still gave their military services to earls and jarls as battlefield companions, making them the rough equivalent to the huscarls of the late Anglo-Saxon period.\\n\\nBeing military commanders, hersirs typically donned superior equipment to the men they led on their raids. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence. Given its comparative cheapness and ease of construction, the spear was one of the most commonly used weapons among all classes of fighting men before and throughout medieval times. Its notable advantage was the longer reach it afforded its bearer, enabling effective engagement with a larger or mounted enemy who might otherwise be out of reach. The Viking tendency to emblazon spears with ostentatious decorative carvings indicates that some were primarily used for thrusting rather than throwing, reducing the possibility of losing what were obviously prized weapons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_vik_jomsvikings_long	According to the 13th century Icelandic Sagas, in the early Middle Ages there existed a fearless warrior-brotherhood of legendary Viking mercenaries, known as the 'Jomsvikings'. Always described as men of unequalled bravery and martial skill, they based themselves in a fortress on the southern Baltic shore in place called Jomsborg from which they took their name. Even in the tough world of the war-ready Vikings, the warriors of Jomsborg were a formidable force with a strict military code, drawing their strength from adventure-seeking fighters recruited from all over the Viking world. They intervened in several dynastic disputes in Sweden and Norway, as well as having fought with distinction in one of the greatest battles of Viking Scandinavia, the Battle of Svoldr.\\n\\nThe Icelandic Sagas also tell of the Jomsvikings’ favoured method of execution, if and when they were captured and were to be put to the sword. The courageous members of the brotherhood would refuse to be killed from behind, always demanding to face their executors to look them in the eye at the moment of death. A piece of corroborating history lies in the fact that the Jomsvikings were said to have fought both for and against English kings, with certain bits of archaeological proof supporting those claims. In a mass grave uncovered in Dorset, the skeletons of fifty-four decapitated Vikings were found, some with teeth filed down – perceived to a Jomsviking demonstration of bravery – and in the all cases, evidence of decapitation executions rather unusually carried out from the front.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_all_royal_spears_long	Throughout most of the medieval world, the function of kings and chiefs was, above all, to provide war leadership. Tribal leaders used loyalty systems which granted the best warriors the greatest rewards when in service to their households as companions or bodyguards, which extended onto the battlefield. The systems which existed in Celtic Ireland and Scotland were ones in which martial leaders presided over small and ever-changing kingdoms alongside nobles and royal followers who fought in their direct service. The Welsh, although less influenced by feudalism, also operated under similar systems of the ‘teulu’ – the individual princes’ and chieftains’ personal bodyguards – who typically went to war alongside larger numbers of freemen who made up the bulk of the armies. Armed with spears, they were arguably wielding the oldest purpose-built weapon in existence.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_sco_alban_swords_long	The early medieval Highlanders of Alba were a cultural mix of Gaelic, Celtic, and other peoples, who had much in common with similar groups in nearby Ireland and northern Britain. Centuries of encounters with invading Romans and the sporadic infighting that followed meant that militarily, they were well-prepared. Organised under local commanders and lords, most males were expected to be ready to fight, but when they were not being called upon to defend their land or clan they farmed and fished alongside their women. Their climate made them particularly tough, readily fighting into the depth of winter when required. Even the Vikings were fearful of the Highlanders of northern Britain by their own accounts – the classic Icelandic saga ‘Islendingasagur’ warns other Norsemen to approach parts of the Scottish coast with caution, lest it cost them their lives!\\n\\nThe warriors of Alba were generally made up of territorial units of fighting men.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_kerns_long	The Middle Irish word ‘ceithern’, pronounced ‘kern’, refers to a group of fighters who were one of two essential components of medieval Irish armies, the other being gallowglasses. Often found fighting as light infantry and occasionally light cavalry, the role of a kern was to provide skirmishing support to their heavy infantry counterparts. However, the training afforded them and the eventual roles they filled very much depended on the needs of their clan, which did not exclude them from the cut and thrust of melee warfare. Kerns would frequently be the first or last to launch attacks – their mobility meant that they were well-suited to initiate swift ambushes, after which they would melt back behind the gallowglasses, while later in battles they could also easily run down any fleeing routers.\\n\\nOn the battlefield, kerns wore a light leather coat which ensured unrestricted movement and agility. The throwing spear or javelin was one such genus of weapons they used, with the thrusting variety not always entirely distinct from the thrown variety. The advantage of the javelin thrower was the ability to potentially pierce through shields and armour from distance, but this was offset by the reduced range and limited output compared to standard archers, since there were only so many javelins a thrower could carry at any one time. Javelin throwing was certainly a unique skill, with the most skilful Viking warriors allegedly even able to catch spears in mid-flight to hurl them straight back!	true

Forming the basis of the free populace, they were neither noblemen nor slaves, ranking above the servile classes but below the nobility. A ceorl’s free status was marked by several factors, such as his attendance at local courts, his payment of dues directly to his lord or king, and perhaps most notably for the era, his right to bear arms. In fact, since many ceorls would have been tenants or even landowners, under Anglo-Saxon law they would have been liable for military duty in the fyrd, as was the case in Wessex.\\n\\nBeing freemen, ceorls would have had to provide their own weaponry.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_iri_gallowglasses_long	Gallowglasses were the super-soldiers of the Celtic world, well-trained heavy infantry skilled in the use of all manner of weapons - swords, spears, javelins, bows, darts – as well as the Celtic martial arts. To be a gallowglass one had to be of mixed blood – descended from the union of a settled Nordic raider and a Celtic woman. When Nordic raiders, who harried the coasts of Scotland and Ireland during the Dark Ages, eventually settled and interbred, the offspring of such unions were known as ‘Gael-gall’ – literally 'foreigners who speak Gaelic'. In Ireland the word ‘Galloglaich’ - pronounced ‘Gallowglass’ – was used to explicitly refer to a 'young, foreign warrior'. As has often been the case throughout history, this mixed blood separated gallowglasses from the hierarchy of the Celtic clan system. As such, they had little loyalty to the old order and many became soldiers for hire to the highest bidder. Although technically under the sovereignty of the Norwegian king during this time, many gallowglasses served Scottish rulers or settled in Ireland, where they were more easily accepted, integrating with the native population at all societal levels.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_wel_old_north_horsemen_long	The Old North is the English translation for the name traditionally used to describe the region of the southern Scottish Lowlands and northern Britain in the early Middle Ages. Known in Welsh as 'Yr Henn Ogledd', in early medieval times these areas were mostly inhabited by people of Celtic descent, remaining culturally and linguistically British even after the arrival of foreign groups. The Old North is considered the birthplace of Welsh literature, thought to be the home of the famous early bards Taliesin and Aneirin, as well as many historical characters that were incorporated into Arthurian legend such as Merlin.\\n\\nPictish art also alludes to the Old North as being inhabited by peoples of horse-warrior societies. Their use of spears from horseback had been seen in a similar form around Britain before, with the Roman use of lance-bearing cavalry regiments. Advancements in horse training techniques and more significantly, the adoption of the stirrup into Western Europe, meant that horses were no longer primarily just a means to get to the battlefield. Mounted warriors previously ran a considerable risk of being unhorsed by the slightest impacts, nor could they carry out any significant blows without becoming unbalanced and vulnerable. Stirrups ensured stability, so that what had formerly been impossible on horseback in the cut and thrust of battle then became easy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_vik_est_kerns_long	In the centuries following the 8th century appearance of the first recorded Viking raiders in the Irish Sea, those of the Norse who chose to settle in the region came to be known as the ‘Ostmenn’, or more literally, ‘the men of the east’. This was how the settled Norse-Gaels contrasted themselves from the native Gaels, who they referred to as ‘Vestmen’, unsurprisingly, the 'men of the west’. Combining local traditions with their own, the Norse-Gaels were culturally distinct from both the Gaels and their Scandinavian forefathers. Their hybridisation of traditions took place against the setting of their coastal defensive strongholds, many of which were the nuclei of the powerful independent kingdoms of later years. Norse-Gaelic powerbases would eventually be established in places like Dublin, Galloway, and Mann, amongst other places.\\n\\nAs with many facets of their culture, the martial traditions of the Norse-Gaels retained both Viking and Gaelic elements. Those who by some sequence of events ended up landless and not tied to a lord – particularly those with an aptitude for fighting – sometimes ended up living as outlaws in the mountains and woods. Such combatants were known as ‘widcairns’ or wood kerns, and were feared and hated by sedentary peoples in equal measure. Using their terrain and knowledge of swift ambush tactics, they were formidable fighters who took what they needed from those unfortunate enough to venture into their woodland territories. They operated under the leadership of fiery spirits among the youthful gentry and former nobility of Ireland, pushed to the edges of society with resentments and bravado that made them Robin Hood figures to their followers.	true

The prevalence of hunting and the past presence of stationed Roman archers around Britain meant that it was by no means an unknown discipline, with archer regiment tactics varying between the warring groups of the day. Battles often saw periods of missile volley exchanges before the initial melee engagements, so the skill of the bowmen could really turn the tide of battle, as seen with the success of English longbow regiments of later centuries during the Hundred Years War.	true

As a result, most were captured from the coast of Britannia or on the Vikings' forays down the Volga River, where the Norsemen became known as ‘Slavs’.

Many Irish records of the early medieval period mention the word ‘aire’ to refer to those in between; a catch-all term describing anyone who held an independent legal status. Written laws dating to later centuries, however, use the word ‘airig’ more specifically in references to nobles or chiefs, distinguishing them from commoners. Indeed, Ireland’s sumptuary laws of the 7th and 8th centuries even refer to the colours that each social class were allowed to wear, including those for the Airig nobility – grey, brown, or red.\\n\\nCommanding a ‘cet’ – a military unit of up to one hundred men – the Airig nobility were high-ranking combatants.
